# What is this thing called probability? {4}

## The Set of All Possible Events

### Simulating

```{r}
library(ggformula)
library(dplyr)
theme_set(theme_bw())
# Flip a coin N times and compute the running proportion of heads at each flip.
# Generate a random sample of N flips (heads = 1, tails = 0):
flipSequence <- 
  function(size = 500, p = 0.5) {
    sample(c(0, 1), prob = c(1 - p, p), size = size, replace = TRUE)
  }

A <-
  data_frame(
    n = 1:500,
    flip = flipSequence(500),
    running_count = cumsum(flip),
    running_prop  = running_count / n
  )

gf_line(
  running_prop ~ n, data = A, 
  color = "skyblue",
  ylim = c(0, 1.0), 
  xlab = "Flip Number", ylab = "Proportion Heads", 
  main = "Running Proportion of Heads") %>%
  gf_hline(yintercept = 0.5, linetype = "dotted")


# # Plot a dotted horizontal reference line:
# abline( h = pHeads , lty = "dotted" )
# # Display the beginning of the flip sequence:
# flipLetters <- paste( c("T","H")[flipSequence[1:10]+1] , collapse = "" )
# displayString <- paste0( "Flip Sequence = " , flipLetters , "..." )
# text( N , .9 , displayString , adj = c(1,0.5) , cex = 1.3 )
# # Display the relative frequency at the end of the sequence.
# text( N , .8 , paste("End Proportion =",runProp[N]) , adj = c(1,0.5) , cex = 1.3 )
```


### Deriving

## Probability: Outside or Inside the Head

### Calibrating subjective belief by preferences

### Describing subjective belief maathematically

## Probability Distributions

### Discrete: Probability mass

### Continuous: Density

## Two-Way Distributions

### Conditional probability

### Independence of attributes
