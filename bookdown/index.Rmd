# What's in These Notes

This "book" is a companion to Kruschke's *Doing Bayesian Data Analysis*.
The main reasons for this companion are to use a different style of R code that includes:

* use of modern packages like `tidyverse`, `R2jags`, `bayesplot`, and `ggformula`;
* adherence to a different style guide;
* less reliance on manually editing scripts and more use of resusable code available in packages;
* a workflow that takes advantage of RStudio and RMarkdown.

This is a work in progress. Please accept my apologies in advance for

* errors,
* inconsistencies
* lack of complete coverage

But feel free to post issues on github if you spot things that require attention
or care to make suggestions for improvement.

Iâ€™ll be teaching from this book in Spring 2019, so I expect rapid development
during those months.
