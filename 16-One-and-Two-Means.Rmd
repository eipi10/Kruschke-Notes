# Estimating One and Two Means

## Basic Model for Two Means

### Data

Two variables

  * metric response
  * dichotomous explanatory
 
### Model

The traditional starting point for modeling means is to assume that 
the each group is sampled from a normal distribution 
with unknown mean and a **common standard deviation**.
(We'll see that is no harder to have different standard deviations.)

So for two groups our model has three parameters: two means ($\mu_1$
and $\mu_2$) and one standard deviation $\sigma$.  

Of course, we also need priors for these parameters.
A common prior for the means is a normal distribution.
We will start with a uniform prior for the standard deviation,
but discuss better alternatives shortly.

That gives the following template for our model:

\begin{align*}
Y_{i|g} & \sim {\sf Norm}(\mu_g, \sigma)
\\
\mu_g & \sim {\sf Norm}(?, ?)
\\
\sigma & \sim {\sf Unif}(?, ?)
\end{align*}

The questions marks will be filled in based on considerations of 
the scale (order of magnitude of the data) and the amount of regularizing
we want to do.

## An Old Sleep Study

Cushny, A. R. and Peebles, A. R. (1905) 
"The action of optical isomers: II hyoscines." 
*The Journal of Physiology* 32, 501â€“510.

**Design**: Subjects sleep habits were compared without a sleep inducing
drug and then with to see how two different drugs affected sleep.

### Data

Let's look at the data.  (`extra` = additional sleep on drug; `group` should 
really be `drug`, so let's rename it.)

```{r ch16-sleep-data}
library(ggformula)
library(dplyr)
sleep <- 
  datasets::sleep %>% rename(drug = group)
gf_boxplot(extra ~ drug, data = sleep)
 df_stats(extra ~ drug, data = sleep)
```


### Model

It is simple enough to convert the model description above into a JAGS model,
but we need to fill in those question marks.  Let's try this:

* mean for prior on $\mu_g$: 0
    * corresponds to the drug having no impact on sleep
    * allows drug to increase or decrease sleep without prejudice
    * any other number would require more justification
    * will tend to pull estimates toward 0 (shrinkage) -- we are requiring
    evidence to convince us that the drug does something to sleep.

* sd for prior on $\mu_g$: 3

    * Says we are 95% certain that the average impact of a drug will be between
    -6 and 6 additional hours of sleep and that it is very unlikely the drug
    will change sleep by 9 or more hours.  This is fairly week prior (6 extra
    hours of sleep would be a lot).  This might be chosen in consultation
    with scientists who are more familiar with what is reasonable.
    
* range for $\sigma$: One crude way to set the prior is to give a ball mark
estimate for the the standard deviation of the amount of sleep change in each
treatment group and then make sure we cover a range 3 orders of magnitude in
each direction.

* We can experiment with different priors to see how the impact results.

```{r ch16-sleep1-model, results = "hide"}
library(R2jags)
sleep_model <- function() {
  for (i in 1:Nobs) {
    extra[i] ~ dnorm(mu[drug[i]], 1 / sigma^2)
  }
  for (d in 1:Ndrugs) {
    mu[d] ~ dnorm(0, 1/3^2)          # sd = 3
  }
  sigma ~ dunif(2/1000, 2 * 1000)    # 3 orders of mag each way of 2
  delta_mu    <- mu[2] - mu[1]
  tau         <- 1 / sigma^2               
}

sleep_jags <- 
  jags(
    model = sleep_model,
    parameters.to.save = c("mu", "sigma", "delta_mu"),
    data = list(
      extra = sleep$extra,
      drug  = sleep$drug,
      Nobs  = nrow(sleep),
      Ndrugs = 2
    ),
    DIC = FALSE  # because we haven't discussed deviance yet
  )
```

```{r ch16-sleep1-results}
library(CalvinBayes)
library(bayesplot)
summary(sleep_jags)
sleep_mcmc <- as.mcmc(sleep_jags)
mcmc_areas(sleep_mcmc, prob = 0.95, regex_pars = "mu")
mcmc_areas(sleep_mcmc, prob = 0.95, regex_pars = "sigma")
mcmc_pairs(sleep_mcmc)
mosaic::prop( ~(delta_mu > 0), data = posterior(sleep_jags))
```

### Separate standard deviations for each group

```{r ch16-sleep2-model, results = "hide"}
sleep_model2 <- function() {
  for (i in 1:Nobs) {
    extra[i] ~ dnorm(mu[drug[i]], 1/sigma[drug[i]]^2)
  }
  for (d in 1:Ndrugs) {
    mu[d]    ~  dnorm(0, 1/3^2)
    sigma[d] ~  dunif(2/1000, 2 * 1000)  
    tau[d]   <- 1 / sigma[d]^2
  }
  delta_mu    <- mu[2] - mu[1]
  delta_sigma <- sigma[2] - sigma[1]
}

sleep_jags2 <- 
  jags(
    model = sleep_model2,
    parameters.to.save = c("mu", "sigma", "delta_mu", "delta_sigma", "tau"),
    data = list(
      extra = sleep$extra,
      drug  = sleep$drug,
      Nobs  = nrow(sleep),
      Ndrugs = 2
    ),
    DIC = FALSE
  )
```

```{r ch16-sleep2-results}
library(bayesplot)
library(CalvinBayes)
summary(sleep_jags2)
sleep_mcmc2 <- as.mcmc(sleep_jags2)
mcmc_areas(sleep_mcmc2, prob = 0.95, regex_pars = "mu")
mcmc_areas(sleep_mcmc2, prob = 0.95, regex_pars = "sigma")
mosaic::prop( ~(delta_mu > 0), data = posterior(sleep_jags2))
mosaic::prop( ~(delta_sigma > 0), data = posterior(sleep_jags2))
hdi(sleep_jags2, pars = c("delta"))
hdi(sleep_jags2)
```


### Comparison to t-test

For those who know about 2-sample t tests:

```{r ch16-sleep-t}
t.test(extra ~ drug, data = sleep)
mosaic::prop( ~(delta_mu < 0), data = posterior(sleep_jags2))
```

### ROPE (Region of Practical Equivalence)

Just knowing that two things are not the same is not of much practical use if the difference
is small. One way to quantify this is to specify a **region of practical equivalence** (ROPE).
We could decide, for example, that we are not interested in differences of less than 10 minutes (1/6 hours).  Our ROPE (for the difference in means) would then be the interval
$(-1/6, 1/6)$ and we could ask if there is evidence that the true difference lies outside that 
interval.  This could be checked by seeing if an HDI lies completely outside the ROPE.

```{r ch16-rope-hdi, fig.height = 4}
plot_post(posterior(sleep_jags2)$delta_mu, ROPE = c(-1/6, 1/6),
          hdi_prob = 0.9)
```


## Variations on the theme

### Other distributions for the response

While the normal distributions are commonly used to describe
metric response variables, and many things are normally distributed, 
not everything is.  

1. Skewed distributions.

If we have reason to believe that the shape of the response distribution
(for a given combination of explanatory variables) is skewed (not symmetrical),
then we have two options:

    a. Transform the response variable.
    
    Perhaps $log(y)$ or some other transformation of why is better described
    by a normal distribution than $y$ itself.
    
    b. Choose a skewed distribution.
    
    Althernatively, we could choose a skewed distribution as part of the model.
    
2. Distributions with heavier tails.

Values that are quite far from the mean can have a large impact on what 
values of the man and standard deviation we find credible.  If we suspect
that the response distribution is likely to heavier tails, we can choose
a family of distributions with heavier tails.  This also makes our model
more **robust against outliers** so that if the underlying distribution
is normal but our data has an unusually large or small observation,
the overall fit of the model is less disturbed.

The most commonly used family for this is the family of 
"student" t-distributions. 
If you have seen these before, you probably learned that 

* the student t-distributions have one parameter, called **degrees of freedom**
  (usually denoted $\nu$ -- that's the Greek letter $\nu$).  This is a 
  shape parameter, and as $\nu \to \infty$, the t-distributions become 
  more and more like the standard normal distribution.
  For this reason, we also may refer to $\nu$ as the **normality parameter**.
  
* the student t-distributions are **symmetric about 0**.
  
* the **mean**, **standard deviation**, **variance**, **precision** 
  are given by
  
    quantity            | expression            | valid when
    ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------
    mean                |   0                   | $\nu > 1$
    standard deviation  | $\sqrt{\frac{\nu}{\nu -2}}$ | $\nu > 2$
    variance            | $\frac{\nu}{\nu -2}$  | $\nu > 2$
    standard deviation  | $\frac{\nu - 2}{\nu}$ | $\nu > 2$
    
    (These can fail to exist when the integral involved fail to converge.)
  
We can combine this information to form a more general family of 
t-distributions by shifting and scaling the student t-distributions.
If $T \sim {\sf T}(\nu)$, then

$$ T' = \mu + \frac{1}{\tau} T \sim {\sf T}(\mu, \tau, \nu)$$
will have 

* mean: $\mu$ (provided $\nu > 1$);
* standard deviation: $\sigma \sqrt{\frac{\nu}{\nu - 2}}$ (provided $\nu > 2$)
where $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\tau}}$
* precision: $\tau \frac{\nu -2}{\nu}$

This is how JAGS defines the family of t-distributions.  Note that $\tau$ is
not exactly $\frac{1}{\sigma^2}$, but it is close when $\nu$ is large.

We can use this more general version of a t-distribution in place of a normal
distribution by adding one additional prior -- a prior for $\nu$.  
We want $\nu >1$, so we will use our add and subtract trick to shift it to
a distribution that is always positive. 
One choice would be a shifted exponential
distribution (Gamma distribution with shape parameter 1).
These distributions are heavily skewed, but this is appropriate since
all the action is for small values of $\nu$. If $\nu > 30$, the t distributions
are hardly distinguishable from normal distributions.
If we select a distribution with mean 30, then the distribution will be 
roughly evenly split between "basically normal" and "more spread out than a 
normal distribution".

```{r ch16-exp-dist}
# 29 because we will shift by 1
gamma_params(shape = 1, mean = 29, plot = TRUE)  
pexp(29, rate = 1/29)
```


```{r ch16-sleep3-model}
sleep_model3 <- function() {
  for (i in 1:Nobs) {
    extra[i] ~ dt(mu[drug[i]], 1 / sigma[drug[i]]^2, nu[drug[i]])
  }
  for (d in 1:Ndrugs) {
    mu[d]         ~  dnorm(0, 1/3^2)
    sigma[d]      ~  dunif(2/1000, 2 * 1000)  
    nuMinusOne[d] ~ dexp(1/29)
    nu[d]        <- nuMinusOne[d] + 1
  }
  delta_mu    <- mu[2] - mu[1]
  delta_sigma <- sigma[2] - sigma[1]
}

sleep_jags3 <-   
  jags(
    model = sleep_model3,
    parameters.to.save = c("mu", "sigma", "delta_mu", "delta_sigma", "nu"),
    data = list(
      extra = sleep$extra,
      drug  = sleep$drug,
      Nobs  = nrow(sleep),
      Ndrugs = 2,
      n.iter = 5000
    ),
    DIC = FALSE
  )
```

```{r ch16-sleep3-hdi}
library(bayesplot)
library(CalvinBayes)
summary(sleep_jags3)
sleep_mcmc3 <- as.mcmc(sleep_jags3)
mcmc_areas(sleep_mcmc3, prob = 0.95, regex_pars = "mu")
mcmc_areas(sleep_mcmc2, prob = 0.95, regex_pars = "mu")
mcmc_areas(sleep_mcmc3, prob = 0.95, regex_pars = "sigma")
mcmc_areas(sleep_mcmc3, prob = 0.95, regex_pars = "nu")
mosaic::prop( ~(delta_mu > 0), data = posterior(sleep_jags3))
hdi(sleep_jags3) %>% arrange(chain)
```

In this model we see that protecting our selves with a t distribution rather than a normal
distribution doesn't seem to affect our estimates of `delta` much at all.

```{r ch16-sleep-2v3}
bind_rows(
  hdi(sleep_jags3, pars = "delta") %>% mutate(model = 3),
  hdi(sleep_jags2, pars = "delta") %>% mutate(model = 2)
) %>% arrange (chain, model)
```

### Other Priors for $\sigma$ (or $\tau$)

Andrew Gelman has an 
[entire paper](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/taumain.pdf) 
devoted to the topic of choosing priors for standard deviation in Bayesian models. 
We won't delve into all the details or 
reasons to prefer (or avoid) some priors.  But we will mention some 
of the alternatives available and make a few comments.

0. ${\sf Unif}(a/1000, 1000a)$ for some suitable $a$ based on what we know about the scale of the data.

    We have already seen this above. It relisted here for completeness.
    
    Notes from Gelman's paper:
   
    * Gelman mentions using ${\sf Unif}(0, A)$, which is similar, but 
    doesn't avoid the really small values near 0.
    
    * Gelman claims that this prior often works reasonably well in 
    practice and is  at least a good starting point, especially when 
    the number of groups is small, as it is in our example.
    
1. Improper Uniform prior -- ${\sf Unif}(0 ,\infty)$

Imagine we wanted to have a uniform prior in the interval $(0, \infty)$. 
A little thought shows that there is no such pdf (how tall would it need to be?)
Nevertheless, some models can be fit with an improper prior -- a function that 
has infinite area beneath it and so cannot be a kernel of a distribution.
In this case, we could choose a constant function.
If when multiplied by the likelihood we end up with something is a kernel,
then we end up with a legitimate posterior, even though we used an improper
prior.  But generally speaking, improper priors are not the way to go.
They can cause trouble for numerical algorithms (if they allow it at all),
and there are usually better choices for priors.[^16-1]

[^16-1]: A related issue is an improper posterior.  Some combinations of 
prior and likelihood can lead to a posterior with infinite "area/volume".


2. A proper prior with support $(0, \infty)$.

    a. Gamma
    
    The only family we know with support $(0, \infty)$ is the Gamma family.
    But we won't typically use it for this purpose.  (But see below for 
    its connection to $\tau$.)
    
    b. Half-Distributions
    
    If we take the positive half of any distribution that is symmetric
    about 0, we get a "half-distibution".  Half-normal and half-t distributions
    are frequently used as priors for the standard deviation.
    In particular, a half t distrubtion with 1 degree of freedom is called
    a half-Cauchy distribution. This distribution is so braod that it 
    has not mean, so it functions somewhat like a proper substitute for 
    the improper uniform prior.
    
    JAGS is clever enough to create the half distribution for us
    if we code things as if we are using a prior for $\sigma$ that
    is symmetric around 0 -- no need to say "half".
    
3. Dealing with precision ($\tau$) directly.

    Instead of coming up with a prior for $\sigma$, we could instead come up
    with a prior for the variance ($\sigma^2$) or the precision ($\tau$)
    instead.  A gamma distribuiton is frequently used here because it happens
    to also be a conjugate prior in many situations involving normal 
    distributions. The only tricky part here is choosing parameters for 
    the gamma prior that correspond to our intitution since we are less 
    familiar with precision than with standard deviation.
    
    Side note: The reason JAGS uses precision for normal distributions 
    rather than standard deviation or variance is because Gamma distributions
    are a conjugate prior for precision in simple models based on the normal
    distribution, and BUGS (which predated JAGS) took advantage of conjugate
    priors to make sampling more efficient.
    
### Paired Comparisons

The data actually contain another variable: `ID`.  As it turns out, the same
ten people were tested with each drug.  If we are primarily interested in 
comparing the two drugs, we might take the difference between the extra sleep 
with one drug and with the other drug **for each person**.  This is referred
to as a paired design.

A paired comparison of means is really just looking at one mean -- the mean difference.  We can do this a couple of different ways:

1. Compute the difference before giving data to JAGS
2. Build the differences into the JAGS code.

We will use option 1 here and convert our data so that each row corresponds
to one person and there are separate columns for the extra sleep produced
by each drug.  This is sometimes referred to as converting from **long format**
(more rows, fewer columns) to **wide format** (fewer rows, more columns).
The `tidyr::spread()` function is useful for this. (And `tidyr::gather()`
can be used to convert in the opposite direction.)

```{r ch16-sleep-wide}
library(tidyr) 
sleep_wide <-
  datasets::sleep %>% 
  rename(drug = group) %>%
  mutate(drug = paste0("drug", drug)) %>%
  spread(key = drug, value = extra) 
sleep_wide
sleep_wide <-
  sleep_wide %>%
  mutate(delta = drug2 - drug1)
sleep_wide
gf_boxplot(~ delta, data = sleep_wide)
```

```{r ch16-sleep4-model}
sleep_model4 <- function() {
  for (i in 1:Nsubj) {
    delta[i] ~ dt(mu, 1 / sigma^2, nu)
  }
  mu         ~ dnorm(0, 2)
  sigma      ~ dunif(2/1000, 2 * 1000)
  nuMinusOne ~ dexp(1/29)
  nu        <- nuMinusOne + 1
  tau       <- 1 / sigma^2
}

sleep_jags4 <- 
  jags(
    model = sleep_model4,
    parameters.to.save = c("mu", "sigma", "nu"),
    data = list(
      delta = sleep_wide$delta,
      Nsubj = nrow(sleep_wide)
    ),
    n.iter = 5000,
    DIC = FALSE)
```

```{r ch16-sleep4-jags}
library(bayesplot)
library(CalvinBayes)
summary(sleep_jags4)
sleep_mcmc4 <- as.mcmc(sleep_jags4)
mcmc_areas(sleep_mcmc4, prob = 0.95, pars = "mu")
mcmc_areas(sleep_mcmc4, prob = 0.95, pars = "nu")
mcmc_pairs(sleep_mcmc4)
mosaic::prop( ~(mu > 0), data = posterior(sleep_jags4))
hdi(sleep_jags4, pars = c("mu"))
hdi(sleep_jags4)
```

## How many chains? How long?

### Why multiple chains?

Multiple chains are primarily for diagnostics.  Once we are sure things are behaving as 
they should, we could go back and run one really long chain if we wanted.

### What large n.eff does and doesn't do for us

A large value of `n.eff` makes our estimates more stable. If we run them again, or compare
multiple chains, the HDIs for parameters with larger `n.eff` will change the least. For 
important work, we will run with a modest `n.iter` until we are sure things are working
well.  Then we can increase the number of iterations for final analysis to make sure 
that our estimates are stable.

A large value of `n.eff` does not make our estimates "better" or make the posterior
more concentrated.

## Looking at Likelihood

```{r ch16-liklihood-viz}
likelihood <- function(mu1, sigma1, mu2 = mu1, sigma2 = sigma1, x, y = c(), 
                       log = FALSE) {
  D <- tibble(
    group = c(rep("1", length(x)), rep("2", length(y))),
    l = c(
      dnorm(x, mu1, sigma1, log = log), 
      dnorm(y, mu2, sigma2, log = log)),
    x = c(x, y)
  )
  if (log) {
    logL <- sum(D$l)
    L    <- exp(logL)
    
  } else {
    L    <- prod(D$l)
    logL <- log(L)
  }
  
  T <- tibble(x = mean(x), logL = logL, height = 1.2 * dnorm(0, 0, 1, log = log))

  cat(paste0("log likelihood: ", format(logL)), 
      "; mu: ", format(mu1), ", ", format(mu2), 
      "; sigma: ", format(sigma1), ", ", format(sigma2), "\n")
  
  gf_segment(0 + l ~ x + x, data = D, color = ~ group) %>%
    gf_point(0 ~ x, data = D, color = ~ group) %>%
    gf_function(function(x) dnorm(x, mu1, sigma1, log = log), color = ~"1") %>%
    gf_function(function(x) dnorm(x, mu2, sigma2, log = log), color = ~"2") 
}
```

```{r ch16-likelihood-manipulate, eval = FALSE}
library(manipulate)
manipulate(
  likelihood(MU1, SIGMA1, MU2, SIGMA2, 
             x = c(8, 12), y = c(11, 13), log = LOG) %>% 
    gf_lims(x = c(0, 20), y = c(NA, 0.5)),
  MU1 = slider(5, 15, 10, step = 0.2),
  MU2 = slider(5, 15, 10, step = 0.2),
  SIGMA1 = slider(1, 10, 2, step = 0.2),
  SIGMA2 = slider(1, 10, 2, step = 0.2),
  LOG = checkbox(FALSE, "log likelihood")
)
```



## Exercises {#ch16-exercises}

1. Using the 30-year-olds in the `NHANES` data set (in the NHANES package),
fit a model that compares the mean height for men and women (allowing for 
different standard deviations).
Then and answer the following questions about your model.

    a. Explain your choice of priors.
    a. Does this sample provide enough evidence to conclude that 
    men are taller (on average)?
    a. Does this sample provide enough evidence to conclude
    that the standard deviation of height differs between
    men and women?
    
    ```{r ch16-prob-thirty}
    Thirty <- NHANES::NHANES %>% filter(Age == 30)
    df_stats(Height ~ Gender, data = Thirty)
    gf_dens( ~ Height, color = ~ Gender, data = Thirty, binwidth = 1)
    ```
    
    ```{r ch16-prob-height-model, results = "hide", include = FALSE}
    height_model <- function() {
      for (i in 1:Nobs) {
        height[i] ~ dnorm(mu[sex[i]], 1 / sigma[sex[i]]^2)
      }
      for (s in 1:2) {
        mu[s]    ~ dnorm(140, 1 / 20^2)
        sigma[s] ~ dgamma(2, 0.1)
      }
    }
    height_jags <-
      jags(
        model = height_model,
        parameters.to.save = c("mu", "sigma"),
        data = 
          list(
            sex    = Thirty$Gender,
            height = Thirty$Height,
            Nobs   = nrow(Thirty)
          )
      )
    ```
    
2. Repeat exercise 1, but compare pulse instead of height.

    ```{r ch16-prob-pulse, include = FALSE}
    summary(height_jags)
    ```
    ```{r ch16-prob-pulse-thirty, include = FALSE}
    Thirty <- NHANES::NHANES %>% filter(Age == 30)
    df_stats(Pulse ~ Gender, data = Thirty)
    gf_dens( ~ Pulse, color = ~ Gender, data = Thirty, binwidth = 1)
    ```
    
<!-- Exercise 16.2. [Purpose: More practice using different data files in the high-level script, using a real example, with skewed data.]  -->
3. The typical lifespan of a laboratory rat that eats ad lib is approximately
700 days. When rats are placed on a restricted diet, their longevity can
increase, but there is a lot of variability in lifespans across different
individual rats. Restricting the diet might not only affect the typical
lifespan, but restricting the diet might also affect the variance of the
lifespan across rats. We consider data from R. L. Berger, Boos, and Guess
(1988), as reported in Hand, Daly, Lunn, McConway, and Ostrowski 
(1994, data set #242), and which are available as `CalvinBayes::RatLives`.

    a. Run the two-group analysis on the rat longevity data using a t
    distribution for the response variable. 
    Do the groups appear to differ in their central tendencies 
    and variances? 
    Does the value of the normality
    parameter suggest that the distribution of lifetimes
    has heavier tails than a normal distribution?
    
    b. Did you plot the data before doing part a?  It's a good idea to do
    that.  Create a plot that compares the distributions of rat life
    for the two groups of rats in the data.
    
    c. Your plot should have revealed that within each group the data
    appear to be skewed to the left. That is, within each group, there 
    are many rats that died relatively young, but there are fewer rats
    who lived especially long.
    We could try to implement a skewed noise distribution, 
    or we could try to transform the data so they are approximately 
    symmetric within each group after transformation. 
    We will try the latter approach here. 
    To get rid of leftward skew, we need a transformation that expands 
    larger values more than the smaller values. 
    We will try squaring the data. (You an use `mutate()` 
    to add a new variable containing the square of the lifetimes 
    of the rats to the original data or you can take care of this
    inside the list that you pass to JAGS).
    Do the groups appear to differ in their central tendencies 
    and variances with this model? 
    What does the value of the normality
    parameter suggest about the distribution of the transformed lifetimes?
    
    d. To compare the results of the two models, it is useful to 
    back-transform to the natural scale. Give a 90% posterior HDI 
    for the difference in mean lifetime based on each model. These 
    should both be in units of days.
    
    e. Did you use ROPEs in any of your answers above? If not, go back 
    and do so. (You will need to decide how wide the ROPE should be and
    if/how it changes when you apply the transformation.)

4. In the previous problem, how do the priors for the difference 
in mean lifetimes compare? Sample from the prior to find out.
Be sure to deal appropriately with the transformation so that you
are doing an apples to apples comparison.

<!-- Exercise 16.1. [Purpose: Practice using different data files in the high-level script, with an interesting real example about alcohol preference of sexually frustrated males.]  -->

5. Shohat-Ophir et al. (2012) were interested in alcohol preferences of sexually
deprived male flies. The procedure is illustrated in Figure 16.13, and was
described as follows:

    > One cohort, rejected-isolated, was subjected to courtship conditioning;
    they experienced 1-h sessions of sexual rejection by mated females, three
    times a day, for 4 days. ...Flies in the mated-grouped cohort experienced
    6-h sessions of mating with multiple receptive virgin females (ratio 1:5)
    for 4 days. Flies from each cohort were then tested in a two-choice
    preference assay, in which they voluntarily choose to consume food with or
    without 15% ethanol supplementation. (Shohat-Ophir et al., 2012, p. 1351,
    citations and figure reference removed)

    For each fly, the amount of each type of food consumed was
converted to a preference ratio: the amount of ethanol-supplemented food minus
the amount of regular food divided by the total of both. 
3-day summary preference scores for each individual fruit fly were computed
by summing the consumption of ethanol and non-ethanol across days 6â€“8. 
The amounts of food consumed and the preference ratios are in 
`CalvinBayes::ShohatOphirKAMH2012dataReduced`. 

    a. How big are differences between groups relative
    to the uncertainty of the estimate? What do you conclude?
    (Answer this by computing what Kruschke calls the **effect size**.
    But note: effect size is not well defined; there are many things 
    that go by that name. See, for example, the 
    [Wikipedia article on effect size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size).)
    
    b. Instead of focusing on the relative amounts of ethanol and regular food
    consumed, we might also be interested in the absolute total amount of food
    consumed. Run the analysis on the total consumption data, which has column
    name `GrandTotal` in the data set. What do you conclude? 
   
6. Redo problem 3 in Stan. You only need to do one model (transformed
or untransformed, whichever works better).

    Note: The t distribution in Stan is parameterized differently.
    The normality paramter comes first, then mean, then standard deviation
    (not precision).
