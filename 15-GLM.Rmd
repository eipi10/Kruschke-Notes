# GLM Overview

## Data consists of observations of variables

Rectangular format:

  * rows: one per observation/observational unit (person, thing observed)
  * columns: one per variable (measurement made/recorded)
  
### Variable Roles

Often we will divid up variables into **predictor** or **explanatory** 
varaibles and **predicted** or **response** variables.  This indicates 
that we want to use our model to help us predict the values of some variables
given the values of other variables.

Example: How does a college predict success based on high school GPA and 
SAT/ACT scores?



### Types of Variables

scale     |     metric?    | continuous/discrete
--------- | -------------- | ----------------
ratio     |       M        |        C
interval  |       M        |        C
count     |       M        |        D        
ordinal   |       -        |        D        
nominal   |       -        |        D        


## GLM Framework

First try: $y = h(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k)$

  * but we don't expect the predictors to exactly determine the response,
  so this is doomed to fail.
  
Second try: $y \sim h(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k)$

  * predictors determine a **distribution** for response.
  
  * this is essientially what we will do, but we will refine things a bit
      * this isn't always the easiest way to think about things
      * it's awkward to have $h$ return a distribution
      * some features of the distribution will be determined outside of $h$
      * so $h$ will tell us something about the distribution, but maybe
      not everything
      
   * we have already seen this in action: Alice and Bob shooting free throws
   (or Reginald and Tony throwing at a target).
   
      * predictor: the subject (Alice or Bob)
      * response: hit or miss
      * distribution: Bernoulli with $\theta$ determined by the subject.
      * $h(Alice) = \theta_1$; $h(Bob) = \theta_2$
