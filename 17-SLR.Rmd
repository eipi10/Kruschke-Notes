# Simple Linear Regression

```{r ch17-setupt, include = FALSE}
options(width = 100)
library(rstan)
```

Situation:

* Metric response
* Matric predictor

## The deluxe basic model

### Likelihood

\begin{align*}
y_{i} &\sim {\sf Norm}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &\sim \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i
\end{align*}

Some variations:
  
  * Replace normal distribution with something else (t is common).
  * Allow standard deviations to vary with $x$ as well as the mean.
  * Use a different functional relationship between explanatory and response (non-linear regression)
  
Each of these is relatively easy to do.
The first variation is sometimes called **robust regression** becuase it
is more robust to unusual observations.  Since it is no harder to work 
with t distributions than with normal distributions, that will become our
go-to simple linear regression model.

\begin{align*}
y_{i} &\sim {\sf T}(\mu_i, \sigma, \nu) \\
\mu_i &\sim \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i
\end{align*}

### Priors



We need priors for $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, $\sigma$, and $\nu$.

* $\nu$: We've already seend that a **shifted Gamma** with mean around 
30 works well as a generic prior giving the data room to stear us 
away from normality if warranted.

* $\beta_1$:  The MLE for $\beta_1$ is 

    $$ \hat\beta_1 = r \frac{SD_y}{SD_x}$$
    so it makes sense to have a prior broadly covers
    the interval $(- \frac{SD_y}{SD_x}, \frac{SD_y}{SD_x})$.

* $\beta_0$: The MLE for $\beta_0$ is 

    $$ \hat\beta_0 \; = \;  \overline{y} - \hat \beta_1 \overline{x}  \; = \; \overline{y} - r \frac{SD_y}{SD_x} \cdot \overline{x}$$
    
    so we can pick a prior that broadly covers the interval
    $(\overline{y} - \frac{SD_y}{SD_x} \cdot \overline{x}, \overline{y} - \frac{SD_y}{SD_x} \cdot \overline{x})$
    
* $\sigma$ measures the amount of variability in responses for a 
*fixed value* of $x$ (and is assumed to be the same for each $x$ in
the simple version of the model). A weakly informative prior
should cover the range of reasonable values of $\sigma$ with plenty of
room to spare. 
(Our 2-or-3-orders-of-magnititude-either-way uniform distribution
might be a reasonable starting point.)

Here's the big picture:

## Example: Galton's Data

Since we are looking at regression, let's use an historical data set that
was part of the origins of the regression story: Galton's data on height.
Galton collected data on the heights of adults and their parents.

```{r ch17-galton-look}
head(mosaicData::Galton)
```

To keep things simpler for the moment, let's consider only women, and only one
sibling per family.

```{r ch17-galton-women}
set.seed(54321)
library(dplyr)
GaltonW <-
  mosaicData::Galton %>% 
  filter(sex == "F") %>%
  group_by(family) %>%
  sample_n(1)
```

Galton was interested in how people's heights are related to their parents'
heights. He compbined the parents' heights into the "mid-parent height", which
was the average of the two.

```{r ch17-midparent}
GaltonW <- 
  GaltonW %>%
  mutate(midparent = (father + mother) / 2)
gf_point(height ~ midparent, data = GaltonW, alpha = 0.5)
```

### Describing the model to JAGS

```{r ch17-galton-model}
galton_model <- function() {
  for (i in 1:length(y)) {
    y[i]   ~ dt(mu[i], 1/sigma^2, nu)
    mu[i] <- beta0 + beta1 * x[i]
  }
  sigma ~ dunif(6/100, 6 * 100)
  nuMinusOne ~ dexp(1/29)
  nu <- nuMinusOne + 1
  beta0 ~ dnorm(0, 1/100^2)   # 100 is order of magnitude of data
  beta1 ~ dnorm(0, 1/4^2)     # expect roughly 1-1 slope
}
```

```{r ch17-galton-jags, results = "hide", cache = TRUE}
library(R2jags)
library(mosaic)
galton_jags <-
  jags(
    model = galton_model,
    data = list(y = GaltonW$height, x = GaltonW$midparent),
    parameters.to.save = c("beta0", "beta1", "sigma", "nu"),
    n.iter = 5000,
    n.burnin = 2000,
    n.chains = 4,
    n.thin = 1
  )
```

```{r ch17-galton-summary, fig.height = 5}
library(bayesplot)
library(CalvinBayes)
summary(galton_jags)
mcmc_combo(as.mcmc(galton_jags))
```

### Problems and how to fix them

Clearly something is not working the way we would like with this model!
Here's a clue as to the problem:

```{r ch17-galton-problems}
posterior(galton_jags) %>% 
  gf_point(beta0 ~ beta1, color = ~ chain, alpha = 0.2, size = 0.4) %>%
  gf_density2d(alpha = 0.5)
posterior(galton_jags) %>% filter(iter <= 250, chain == "chain:1") %>%
  gf_step(beta0 ~ beta1, alpha = 0.8, color = ~iter) %>%
  gf_density2d(alpha = 0.2) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_color_viridis_c()) %>%
  gf_facet_wrap(~chain) #, scales = "free")
```

The correlation of the parameters in the posterior distribution produces a 
long, narrow, diagonal ridge that the Gibbs sampler samples only very slowly
because it keeps bumping into edge of the cliff.  (Remember, the Gibbs sampler
only moves in "primary" directions.)

So how do we fix this?
This is supposed to be the *simple* linear model after all.
There are two ways we could hope to fix our problem.

1. **Reparameterize the model** so that the correlation between parameters 
(in the posterior distribution) is reduced or eliminated.

2. **Use a different algorithm** for posterior sampling. The problem is 
not with our model *per se*, rather it is with the method we are using (Gibbs)
to sample from the posterior.  Perhaps another algorithm will work
better.

## Centering and Standardizing


* Reparameterization 1:  **centering**
   
    We can express this model as 
    
    \begin{align*}
    y_{i} &\sim {\sf T}(\mu_i, \sigma, \nu) \\
    \mu_i &= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 (x_i - \overline{x})
    \end{align*}
    
    Since 
    
    \begin{align*}
    \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 (x_i - \overline{x}) 
    &= (\alpha_0 - \alpha_1 \overline{x}) + \alpha_1 x_i 
    \end{align*}

    We see that $\beta_0 = \alpha_0 - \alpha_1 \overline{x}$ and
    $\beta_1 = \alpha_1$. So we can easily recover the original 
    parameters if we like.  (And if we are primarily interested in $\beta_1$,
    no translation is required.)  
    
    This reparameterization maintains the natural scale of the data, and both
    $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ are easily interpreted: $\alpha_0$ is the mean
    response when the predictor is the average of the predictor values *in the data*.
    
    
* Reparameterization 2: **standardization**
    
    We can also express our model as
    
    \begin{align*}
    z_{y_{i}} &\sim {\sf T}(\mu_i, \sigma, \nu) \\[3mm]
    \mu_i     &= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 z_{x_i} \\[5mm]
    z_{x_i}   &=    \frac{x_i - \overline{x}}{SD_x} \\[3mm]
    z_{y_i}   &=    \frac{y_i - \overline{y}}{SD_y} \\[3mm]
    \end{align*}
    
    Here the change in the model is due to a transformation of the data.  Subtracting the mean
    and dividing by the standard deviation is called **standardization**, and the values
    produced are sometimes called **z-scores**. The resulting distributions of $zy$ and $zx$
    will have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. So in addition to breaking the correlation
    pattern, we have now put things on a standard scale, regardless of what the original
    units were. This can be useful for picking constants in priors (we won't have to estimate
    the scale of the data involved). In addition, some algorithms work better if all the
    variables involved have roughly the same scale.
    
    The downside is that we usually need to convert back to the original scales of 
    $x$ and $y$ in  order to interpret the results. But this is only a matter
    of a little easy algebra:
    
    \begin{align*} 
    \hat{z}_{y_i} &= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 z{x_i}
    \\
    \frac{\hat{y}_i - \overline{y}}{SD_y} &= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \frac{x_i - \overline{x}}{SD_x}
    \\
    \hat{y}_i &= \overline{y} + \alpha_0 SD_y + \alpha_1 SD_y \frac{x_i - \overline{x}}{SD_x}
    \\
    \hat{y}_i &= 
    \underbrace{\left[\overline{y} + \alpha_0 SD_y - \alpha_1\frac{SD_y}{SD_x} \overline{x} \right]}_{\beta_0} + 
    \underbrace{\left[\alpha_1 \frac{SD_y}{SD_x}\right]}_{\beta_1} x_i
    \end{align*}

Since Kruscske demonstrates standardization, we'll do centering here.

```{r ch17-galton-jags-centering, results = "hide", cache = TRUE}
galtonC_model <- function() {
  for (i in 1:length(y)) {
    y[i]   ~ dt(mu[i], 1/sigma^2, nu)
    mu[i] <- alpha0 + alpha1 * (x[i] - mean(x))
  }
  sigma ~ dunif(6/100, 6 * 100)
  nuMinusOne ~ dexp(1/29)
  nu <- nuMinusOne + 1
  alpha0 ~ dnorm(0, 1/100^2)   # 100 is order of magnitude of data
  alpha1 ~ dnorm(0, 1/4^2)     # expect roughly 1-1 slope
  beta0 = alpha0 - alpha1 * mean(x)
  beta1 = alpha1               # not necessary, but gives us both names
}
galtonC_jags <-
  jags(
    model = galtonC_model,
    data = list(y = GaltonW$height, x = GaltonW$midparent),
    parameters.to.save = c("beta0", "beta1", "alpha0", "alpha1", "sigma", "nu"),
    n.iter = 5000,
    n.burnin = 2000,
    n.chains = 4,
    n.thin = 1
  )
```


```{r ch17-galton-centering-look, fig.height = 7}
summary(galtonC_jags)
mcmc_combo(as.mcmc(galtonC_jags))
```

Ah! That looks much better than before.

### $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are still correlated

Reparameterization has not changed our model, only the way it is described.
In particular, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ remain correlated in the 
posterior. But $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ are not correlated, and these
are the parameters JAGS is using to sample.

```{r ch17-still-correlated}
gf_point(beta1 ~ beta0, data = posterior(galtonC_jags), alpha = 0.1)
gf_point(alpha1 ~ alpha0, data = posterior(galtonC_jags), alpha = 0.1)
```

## We've fit a model, now what?

After centering or standardizing, JAGS works much better. We can now sample from
our posterior distribution. But what do we do with our posterior samples?


### Estimate parameters

If we are primarily interested in a regression parameter 
(usually the slope parameter is much more interesting than the intercept 
parameter), we can use an HDI to express our estimate.

```{r ch17-galtonC-estimate-params}
hdi(posterior(galtonC_jags), pars = "beta1")
mcmc_areas(as.mcmc(galtonC_jags), pars = "beta1", prob = 0.95)
```

Galton noticed what we see here: that the slope is less than 1. This means that
children of taller than average parents tend to be shorter than their parents
and children of below average parents tend to be taller than their parents.
He referred to this in his paper as 
["regression towards mediocrity"](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~nchristo/statistics100C/history_regression.pdf). As it turns out, this was not a special feature
of the heridity of heights but a general feature of linear models.
Find out more in this [Wikipedia artilce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean).



### Make predictions

Suppse we know the heights of a father and mother, from which we compute
ther mid-parent height $x$. 
How tall would we predict their daughters will be as adults? 
Each posterior sample provides an answer
by describing a t distribution with `nu` degrees of freedom, 
mean $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x$, and standard deviation $\sigma$.

The posterior distribution of the average hieght of daughters born 
to parents with midparent height $x = 70$ is shown below, along 
with an HDI.

```{r ch17-galtonC-preditions}
posterior(galtonC_jags) %>% 
  mutate(mean_daughter = beta0 + beta1 * 70) %>%
  gf_dens(~mean_daughter)
Galton_hdi <-
  posterior(galtonC_jags) %>% 
  mutate(mean_daughter = beta0 + beta1 * 70) %>%
  hdi(pars = "mean_daughter")
Galton_hdi
``` 

So on average, we would predict the daughters to be about
66 or 67 inches tall.

We can visualize this by drawing a line for each posterior sample.
The HDI should span the middle 95% of these.

```{r ch17-galtonC-showlines}
gf_abline(intercept = ~beta0, slope = ~beta1, alpha = 0.01,
          color = "steelblue", 
          data = posterior(galtonC_jags) %>% sample_n(2000)) %>%
  gf_point(height ~ midparent, data = GaltonW, 
           inherit = FALSE, alpha = 0.5) %>%
  gf_errorbar(lo + hi ~ 70, data = Galton_hdi, color = "skyblue", 
              width = 0.2, size = 1.2, inherit = FALSE)
```

But this may not be the sort of prediction we want. Notice that most daughters'
heights are not in the blue band in the picture. That band tells about
the *mean* but doesn't take into account how much individuals vary about 
that mean.  We can add that information in by taking our estimate for 
$\sigma$ into account.

Here we generate heights by adding noise to the estimate given by 
values of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$.

```{r ch17-galtonC-plot-predictions}
posterior(galtonC_jags) %>%  
  mutate(new_ht = beta0 + beta1 * 70 + rstudent_t(1200, df = nu, sd = sigma)) %>%
  gf_point(new_ht ~ 70, alpha = 0.01, size = 0.7, color = "steelblue") %>%
  gf_point(height ~ midparent, data = GaltonW, 
           inherit = FALSE, alpha = 0.5) 
```

```{r ch17-galtonC-predinterval}
Galton_hdi2 <-
  posterior(galtonC_jags) %>% 
  mutate(new_ht = beta0 + beta1 * 70 + rstudent_t(1200, df = nu, sd = sigma)) %>%
  hdi(regex_pars = "new") 
Galton_hdi2
```

So our model expects that most daughters whose parents have a midparent height 
of 70 inches are between  
`r round(Galton_hdi2$lo, 1)` and
`r round(Galton_hdi2$hi, 1)` 
inches tall. Notice that this interval
is taking into account both the uncertainty in our estimates of the
parameters $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, $\sigma$, and $\nu$ and the variability in 
heights that $\sigma$ and $\nu$ indicate.

### Posterior Predictive Checks

With a little more work, we can create intervals like this at several different
midparent heights.

```{r ch17-galtonC-ppc}
Post_galtonC <- posterior(galtonC_jags)

Grid <- 
  expand.grid(midparent = 60:75, iter = 1:nrow(Post_galtonC)) 
 
posterior(galtonC_jags) %>%
  mutate(noise = rstudent_t(12000, df = nu, sd = sigma)) %>%
  left_join(Grid) %>%
  mutate(height = beta0 + beta1 * midparent + noise) %>% 
  group_by(midparent) %>%
  do(hdi(., pars = "height")) 

posterior(galtonC_jags) %>%
  mutate(noise = rstudent_t(12000, df = nu, sd = sigma)) %>%
  left_join(Grid) %>%
  mutate(avg_height = beta0 + beta1 * midparent,
         height = avg_height + noise) %>% 
  group_by(midparent) %>%
  do(hdi(., pars = "height")) %>%
  gf_ribbon(lo + hi ~ midparent, fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.2) %>%
  gf_errorbar(lo + hi ~ midparent, width = 0.2, color = "steelblue", size = 1.2) %>%
  gf_point(height ~ midparent, data = GaltonW, 
           inherit = FALSE, alpha = 0.5)
```

Comparing the data to the posterior predictions of the model is called a 
**posterior predictive check**; we are checking to see whether the data 
are consistent with what our posterior distribution would predict.
In this case, things look good: most, but not all of the data is falling
inside the band where our models predicts 95% of new observations would 
fall.

If the posterior predictive check indicates systematic problems with our model,
it may lead us to propose another (we hope better) model.

### Posterior predictive checks with bayesplot

It takes a bit of work to construct the data needed for the plot above.  The
bayesplot package provides a number of posterior predicitive check (ppc) plots.
These functions require two important inputs:

* `y`: a vector of response values -- usually the values from the original data set.
* `yrep`: a matrix of simulated `y` values.  Each row corresponds to one 
posterior sample. There is one column for each value of `y`.  

So the rows of `yrep` can be compared with `y` to see if the model
is behaving well.

Side note: We can compute our simulated $y$ values using predictor values
that are just like in our data or using other predictor values of our choosing.
The second options lets on consider counterfactual situations.
To distinguish these, some people use $y_rep$ for the former and 
$\tilde{y}$ for the latter.

Now all the work is in creating the `yrep` matrix. To simplify that, we will use
`CalvinBayes::posterior_calc()`. We will do this two ways, once for average 
values of height and once for individual values of height (taking into account the 
variability from person to person as quantified by $\nu$, and $\sigma$.

```{r ch17-galton-yrep}
y_avg <- 
  posterior_calc(
    galtonC_jags, 
    height ~ beta0 + beta1 * midparent, 
    data = GaltonW)
y_ind <- 
  posterior_calc(
    galtonC_jags, 
    height ~ 
      beta0 + beta1 * midparent + rstudent_t(nrow(GaltonW), df = nu, sd = sigma), 
    data = GaltonW)
```

The various posterior predictive check plots begin `ppc_`.  Here is an example:

```{r ch17-ppc-interval}
ppc_intervals(GaltonW$height, y_avg, x = GaltonW$midparent)
ppc_intervals(GaltonW$height, y_ind, x = GaltonW$midparent)
```

If we want a ribbon, like in our plot above, we can almost get it,
but `ppc_ribbon()` connects the dots in a way that isn't useful for this 
model.

```{r ch17-ppc-ribbon}
ppc_ribbon(GaltonW$height, y_ind, x = GaltonW$midparent)
```

Fortunately, we can request the data used to create the plot and make our
own plot however we like.

```{r ch17-ppc-ribbon-data}
plot_data <- 
  ppc_ribbon_data(GaltonW$height, y_ind, x = GaltonW$midparent)
glimpse(plot_data)
plot_data %>%
  gf_ribbon(ll + hh ~ x, fill = "steelblue") %>%
  gf_ribbon(l + h ~ x, fill = "steelblue") %>%
  gf_line(m ~ x, color = "steelblue") %>%
  gf_point(y_obs ~ x, alpha = 0.5)
plot_data %>%
  gf_smooth(ll ~ x, color = "steelblue") %>%
  gf_smooth(hh ~ x, color= "steelblue") %>%
  gf_smooth(m ~ x, color= "steelblue") %>%
  gf_point(y_obs ~ x, alpha = 0.5)
```


There are quite a number of these, but most only work for certain types of 
models.

```{r ch17-apropos-ppc}
apropos("^ppc_")
```

## Fitting models with Stan

Centering (or standardizing) is sufficient to make JAGS efficient enough to use.
But we can also use Stan, and since Stan is not bothered by correlation in the
posterior the way JAGS is, Stan works well even without reparamterizing the model.

Here is the Stan equivalent to our original JAGS model.

```{stan ch17-galton_stan, output.var = "galton_stan", cache = TRUE, results = "hide"}
data {
  int<lower=0> N;     // N is a non-negative integer
  vector[N] y;          // y is a length-N vector of reals
  vector[N] x;          // x is a length-N vector of reals
}
parameters {
  real beta0;  
  real beta1;  
  real<lower=0> sigma;
  real<lower=0> nuMinusOne;
} 
transformed parameters{
  real<lower=0> nu;
  nu = nuMinusOne + 1;
}
model { 
  // we could use a for loop like this:
    // for (i in 1:N) {
    //  y[i] ~ student_t(nu, beta0 + beta1 * x[i], sigma);
    //}
  // but vectorization makes things terser:
  y ~ student_t(nu, beta0 + beta1 * x, sigma);
  beta0 ~ normal(0, 100);
  beta1 ~ normal(0, 4);
  sigma ~ uniform(6.0 / 100.0, 6.0 * 100.0);
  nuMinusOne ~ exponential(1/29.0);
}
```

```{r ch17-galton-sampling, results = "hide"}
library(rstan)
galton_stanfit <-
  sampling(
    galton_stan,
    data = list(
      N = nrow(GaltonW),
      x = GaltonW$midparent,
      y = GaltonW$height
    ),
    chains = 4,
    iter = 2000,
    warmup = 1000
  )  
```

Note that the slope and intercept parameters remain correlated in the posterior,
but this doesn't bother Stan the way it bothers JAGS.

```{r ch17-galton-stan-look}
galton_stanfit
gf_point(beta1 ~ beta0, data = posterior(galton_stanfit), alpha = 0.5)
```

```{r ch17-galton-stan-combo, fig.height = 5}
mcmc_combo(as.mcmc.list(galton_stanfit), 
           pars = c("beta0", "beta1", "sigma", "nu"))
```


## Multiple Intercepts model

In the example above we have been dealing with the women alone, but we can build 
a model that handles men and women at the same time. One such model is the 
"mutliple intercpets" model. In this model, both groups (men and women) will 
have the same slope, but the intercepts are allowed to differ.

```{stan ch17-galton2_stan, output.var = "galton2_stan", cache = TRUE, results = "hide"}
data {
  int<lower=0> N;     // N is a non-negative integer
  vector[N] y;        // y is a length-N vector of reals
  vector[N] x;        // x is a length-N vector of reals
  int<lower=1> g[N];  // g is a length-N vector of integers (for groups)
}
parameters {
  real beta0;  
  real beta1;  
  real beta2;  
  real<lower=0> sigma;
  real<lower=0> nuMinusOne;
} 
transformed parameters{
  real<lower=0> nu;
  nu = nuMinusOne + 1;
}
model { 
  for (i in 1:N) {
    y[i] ~ student_t(nu, beta0 + beta1 * x[i] + beta2 * g[i], sigma);
  }
  beta0 ~ normal(0, 100);
  beta1 ~ normal(0, 4);
  beta2 ~ normal(0, 4);
  sigma ~ uniform(6.0 / 100.0, 6.0 * 100.0);
  nuMinusOne ~ exponential(1/29.0);
}
```

```{r ch17-galton2-sampling, results = "hide", cache = TRUE}

      N = nrow(GaltonBoth),
      x = GaltonBoth$midparent,
      y = GaltonBoth$height,
      g = as.numeric(factor(GaltonBoth$sex))
    ),
    chains = 4,
    iter = 2000,

  )

```{r ch17-galton2-ppc}
GaltonBoth <- GaltonBoth %>% mutate(g = as.numeric(sex))
head(GaltonBoth, 3)
yind <-
  posterior_calc(
    galton2_stanfit, 
    yind ~ beta0 + beta1 * midparent + beta2 * g +  rstudent_t(nrow(GaltonBoth), df = nu, mean = 0, sd = sigma),
    data = GaltonBoth
  )
ppc_intervals_grouped(
  GaltonBoth$height, yind, group = GaltonBoth$sex, 
  x = GaltonBoth$midparent) 

ppc_data <-
  ppc_intervals_data(
  GaltonBoth$height, yind, group = GaltonBoth$sex, 
  x = GaltonBoth$midparent)
glimpse(ppc_data)
gf_ribbon(ll + hh ~ x, fill = ~ group, data = ppc_data) %>%
  gf_ribbon(l + h ~ x, fill = ~ group, data = ppc_data) %>%
  gf_point(y_obs ~ x, color =  ~ group, data = ppc_data) %>%
  gf_facet_grid(group ~ .)
```

We could let other things differ accross groups as well: slopes, sigmas, nu,
etc. All of this is easily doable in JAGS or Stan, but for some of these, it
is best to use a prior with correlation among certain pairs of parameters.

## Exercises {#ch17-exercises}

1. Use Galton's data on the men to estimate 

    a. The average of height of men whose parents are 65 and 72 inches tall.
    b. The middle 50% of heights of men whose parents are 65 and 72 inches tall.
    
    You may use either JAGS or Stan.
    
2. When centering, why did we center x but not y?
