# Multiple Nominal Predictors

## Crop Yield by Till Method and Fertilizer

The data in `CalvinBayes::SplitPlotAgri` are from an agricultural study in which 
different tilling methods and different fertilizers were used and the crop yield (in
bushels per acre) was subsequently measured.

```{r ch20-splitplot-plot}
gf_point(Yield ~ Fert | ~ Till, data = SplitPlotAgri, alpha = 0.4, size = 4)
```

Here are two models. See if you can figure out what they are.
(How can you use R to check if you are correct?)

* What parameters does each model have?
* Write a formula that describes the model. Be sure to clarify what the variables
mean.
* How would you use each model to estimate the mean yield when using ridge tilling
and deep fertilizer?  (Imagine that you already have the posterior distribution in 
hand.)


```{r ch20-fert1, results = "hide", cache = TRUE}
fert1_brm <-
  brm(Yield ~ Till + Fert, data = SplitPlotAgri)
```

\vfill

```{r ch20-fert2, results = "hide", cache = TRUE}
fert2_brm <-     
  brm(Yield ~ Till * Fert, data = SplitPlotAgri)
```

\vfill

In each of these models, the response (yield) is normally distributed
around a mean value that depends on the type of fertilizer and tilling method
used:

\begin{align*}
Y_i &\sim \mu_i + {\sf Norm}(0, \sigma) \\
Y_i &\sim  {\ sf Norm}(\mu_i, \sigma)
\end{align*}

In model 1, the two nominal predictors are converted into indicator variables:

\begin{align*}
x_1 &= [\![ \mathrm{Till} = \mathrm{Moldbrd} ]\!] \\
x_2 &= [\![ \mathrm{Till} = \mathrm{Ridge} ]\!] \\
x_3 &= [\![ \mathrm{Fert} = \mathrm{Deep} ]\!] \\
x_4 &= [\![ \mathrm{Fert} = \mathrm{Surface} ]\!] \\
\end{align*}

So the model becomes (omitting the subscripted $i$):

\begin{align*}
\mu &=  \beta0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \beta_4 x_4 
\\
&=
\beta_0 +
\beta_1 [\![ \mathrm{Till} = \mathrm{Moldbrd} ]\!] +
\beta_2 [\![ \mathrm{Till} = \mathrm{Ridge} ]\!] 
\beta_3 [\![ \mathrm{Fert} = \mathrm{Deep} ]\!] +
\beta_4 [\![ \mathrm{Fert} = \mathrm{Surface} ]\!] +
\end{align*}

We can visualize this in a tabular form as 

&nbsp;  | Chisel | Moldbrd | Ridge
------- | ----- | ---- | --------
Broad   | $\beta_0$  | $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ | $\beta_0 + \beta_2$
Deep    | $\beta_0 + \beta_3$  | $\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_3$ | $\beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$
Surface | $\beta_0 + \beta_4$  | $\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_4$ | $\beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_4$

```{r ch20-fert1-summary}
fert1_brm  
```

Note that this model implies that the difference in yield between using
two fertilizers is the same for each of the three tilling methods and the 
difference due to tilling methods is the same for each of the three fertilizers.
This may not be a reasonable assumption.  Perhaps some fertilizers work better
with certain tilling methods than with others. Model 2 allows for this.

The interaction (`Till * Fert`) creates additional new variables of the form
$x_i x_j$ where $i = 1$ or $2$ and $j = 3$ or $4$. 
For example,
\begin{align*}
x_1 x_3 &=  
    [\![ \mathrm{Till} = \mathrm{Moldbrd} ]\!] \cdot
    [\![ \mathrm{Fert} = \mathrm{Deep}    ]\!] \\
    & = 
    [\![ \mathrm{Till} = \mathrm{Moldbrd} \mathrm{\ and \ }
         \mathrm{Fert} = \mathrm{Deep} ]\!] 
\end{align*}

If we let $\beta_{i:j}$ be the coefficient on $x_i x_j$, then our table for
$\mu$ becomes

&nbsp;  | Chisel | Moldbrd | Ridge
------- | ----- | ---- | --------
Broad   | $\beta_0$  | $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ | $\beta_0 + \beta_2$
Deep    | $\beta_0 + \beta_3$  | $\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_3 + \beta_{1:3}$ | $\beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_3 + \beta_{2:3}$
Surface | $\beta_0 + \beta_4$  | $\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_4 + \beta_{1:4}$| $\beta_0 + \beta_2 + \beta_4 + \beta_{2:4}$

```{r ch20-fert2-summary}
fert2_brm  
```

In this model, there is are no dependencies among the various group means and the
interaction parameters ($\beta_{i:j}$) are a measure of how much this mattered.
(If they are close to 0, then this will be very much like the additive model.)

As before, we can opt to fit the model without an intercept. This produces a 
different parameterization of the same model.

```{r ch20-fert2a, results = "hide", cache = TRUE}
fert2a_brm <-   
  brm(Yield ~ 0 + Till * Fert, data = SplitPlotAgri)
```

```{r ch20-fert2a-summary}
fert2a_brm
```

### What does $\sigma$ represent?

In each of these models, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of yield for
all plots (not just those in our data) with a given combination of fertilizer
and tilling method.  These models specify that the standard deviation is the same
in each of these groups (but we could modify that assumption and estimate 
separate standard deviations in each group if we wanted). The estimate of $\sigma$
is a bit smaller for the model with interaction because the added flexibility
of the model allows us to estimate the means more flexibly.


\newpage

## Split Plot Design

There is a bit more to our story.  The study used 33 different fields.  Each field
was divided into 3 sections and a different fertilizer was applied to each of the 
three sections. (Which fertilizer was used on which section was determined at random.)
This is called a "split-plot design" (even if it is applied to things that are not
fields of crops).

It would have been possible to divide each field into 9 sub-plots and use all
combinations of tilling and fertilizer, but that's not how this study was done.
The tilling method was the same for the entire field -- likely because it was 
much more efficient to plow the fields this way. 

The plot below indicates that different fields appear to have different baseline
yields since the dots associated with one field tend to be near the top or bottom
of each of the fertilizer clusters.  We can add an additional variable to our
model to handle this situation.

```{r ch20-splitplot-plot-with-fields}
gf_point(Yield ~ Fert | ~ Till, data = SplitPlotAgri, alpha = 0.4, size = 4) %>%
  gf_line(group = ~Field)
```

```{r ch20-fert3, results = "hide", cache = TRUE}
fert3_brm <-
  # the use of factor() is important here because the field ids are numbers
  # factor converts this into a factor (ie, a nominal variable)
  brm(Yield ~ Till * Fert + factor(Field), data = SplitPlotAgri)
```
```{r ch19-fert3-summary}
fert3_brm
```

That's a lot of output. And the model is performing badly. Fortunately,
we don't really want this model anyway.
We now have a an adjustment for each field, and there 
were 33 fields. But we are not really interested in predicting
the yield *for a given field*. Our primary interest is in which fertilizers
and tilling methods work well. We hope our results apply generally to all fields.
So field field plays a different role in this study. 
We are only comparing 3 fertilizers and 3 tilling methods,
but there are many more fields than the 33 in our study. They are intended to
be representative of all fields (and their variable quality for producing large
yields). 

If we think that field quality might be described by a normal distribution (or
some other distribution), we might be more interested in the parameters of that
distribution than in the specific estimates for the particular fields in this
study. The kind of model we want for this is called a **hierarchical** or **multi-level** model, and `brm()` makes it easy to describe such a model.

Here's a way to think about such a model

  * Each field has a baseline productivity.
  * The baseline productivities are normal with some mean and standard
  deviation that tell us about the distribution of productivity among 
  fields.  Our 33 fields should helps us estimate this distribution.
  * That baseline productivity can be adjusted up or down depending on the 
  tilling method and fertilizer used.

In `brm()` lingo, the effect of field is to adjust the intercept, so we can write
it like this:


```{r ch20-fert4, results = "hide", cache = TRUE}
fert4_brm <-
  brm(Yield ~ Till * Fert + (1 | Field), data = SplitPlotAgri)
```


We can see in the output below that the variability from plot to plot is 
estimated by a standard deviation of roughly 8 to 15. Individual field
estimates are hidden in this report, but you can see them if you type
`stanfit(fert_brm)`.

```{r ch19-fert4-summary}
fert4_brm
```

The three groupings of the parameters shows are 

* group-level effects

    This is where we find the standard deviation associated with 
    `Field`. We are interested in the fields as a group, not as individual
    fields.

* population-level effects
  
    The parameters for `Till` and `Fert` go here.
    

* family specific

    This is where we find parameters associated with the "noise" of the model,
    in this case the standard deviation of the normal distribution.
    If we used a t-distribution, we would find `nu` and `sigma` here.

## Which model should we use?

### Modeling Choices

Now that we are able to create more and more kinds of models, model selection
is going to become a bigger issue. 
Here are just some of the choices we now have when constructing a model.

1. What variables?
    
    If our primary goal is to study the association between the 
    response and certain predictor variables, we need to include
    those variables in the model.
   
    But additional variables can be helpful if they explain some of the 
    variation in the response variable in a way that makes it easier 
    to see the association with the variables of interest.
    
    Since we have information about fields, and it seems plausible that 
    productivity varies by field, we prefer models include `Field`.
    Similarly, even if we were only intersted in one of fertilizer or tilling
    method, it may be useful to include both.
    
    We might wish for some additional variables for our study of crop yields.
    Perhaps knowing additional information about the fields (soil type,
    hilly or flat? water shed or water basin? previous years crop, etc.). 
    Any of these things might help explain the variation from field 
    to field.
    
    But adding too many variables can actually make this worse!
    
    * If variables are correlated in our data (colinearity of predictors),
    including both will usually make our posterior distributions
    for the associated parameters much wider.
    
    * Additional variables can lead to over-fitting. Additional variables
    will always make our model fit the current data set better, but eventually
    we will begin fitting the idiosyncracies of our particular data set
    rather than patterns that are likely to extend to new observations.

2. Interaction terms?

    When we use more than one predictor, we need to decide whether to include
    interaction terms. Interaction is important to include if we are open to
    to the possibility that the "effect" of one variable on the response
    may depend on the value of some other variable.
    
3. Noise distribution?

    Normal distributions are traditional and relatively easy to interpret.
    T distributions are more robust against unusual observations or 
    heavy tailed distributions.  Both of these are symmetric distributions.
    If we expect or see evidience of a lack of symmetry, we may need to 
    use transformations of the data or other families of distributions.

4. What priors?

    Bayesian inference adds another layer: prior selection. For most of our 
    models we have used "weakly informed priors". These priors avoid parameter
    values that are impossible (negative values for standard deviations, for
    example) and provide crude order-of-magnitude guidance.  They can also
    serve a mild regularizing effect (shrinking parameter estimates toward 0,
    for example, to counter against over fitting). If more information is 
    available, it is possible to use more informed priors.
    
    Choice of prior matters more for small data sets than for large data sets.
    This makes sense both mathematically and intuitively.  Intiuitively,
    if we don't have much new data, it won't change our beliefs much from what
    they were before. But if we have a lot of data, we will come to roughly
    the same conclusion no matter what we believed before.

5. Multi-level?
  
    Are the values of nominal variables in our data exhaustive of the 
    possibilities (or of our interests)? Or are they just representative 
    of a larger set of possible values? 
    In the latter case, a multi-level model may be called for.
    
    To clarify this, it can be good to imagine expanding the data set. If you were
    to collect additional data, would the variables take on new values?
    In our crop yield study, adding more data would require using new fields,
    but we could still use the same three fertilizers and same three tilling 
    methods.  Furthermore, the three tilling methods selected are not likely
    representative of some distribution of tilling methods the way the fields
    studied might be representative of many fields in a given region.
    
These are only some of the questions we need to answer when constructing a model.
But how do we decide? Part of the decision is based on things we know or believe
in advance. Our model may be designed to reflect a theory about how data 
are generated or may be informed by other studies that have been done in similar
situations. But there are also ways to investigate and compare models.

### Measuring a Model -- Prediction Error

#### Prediction vs. Observation

One way to measure how well a model is working is to compare the predictions
the model makes for the response variable $\hat y_i$ to the observed 
response values in the data $y_i$. To simplify things, we would like to convert
these $n$ predictions and $n$ observations into a single number.

If you have taken a statistics course before, you may have done this using
**Sum of Squared Errors** (SSE) or **Mean Squared Error** (MSE).


\begin{align*}
SSE & = \sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \hat y_i)^2 \\
MSE & = \frac{1}{n} SSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \hat y_i)^2
\end{align*}

If you are familiar with $r^2$, it is related to MSE:

\begin{align*}
SSE &= \sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \hat y_i)^2 \\
SST &= \sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \overline{y})^2 \\
r^2 &= 1 - \frac{SSE}{SST}
\end{align*}

We are working with Bayesian models, so $SSE$, $MSE$ and $r^2$ have posterior
distributions, since they depend on (the posterior distribution of) $\theta$. 
Each posterior value of $\theta$ leads to a value of $\hat y_i = E(y_i \mid \theta)$
and that in turn leads to a values of $SSE$, $MSE$, and $r^2$. 

Putting that all together to highlight the dependence on $\theta$, we get

$$MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - E(y_i \mid \theta))^2$$

The intuition behind all three quantities is that model fit can be measured 
by how close the model prediction $\hat y_i$  is to the obsered resopnse $y_i$.
$MSE$ adjusts for sample size to make it easier to compare values
across data sets of different sizes. $r^2$ makes a further normalization to
put things on a 0-1 scale.  (1 is a perfect fit. 0 means the model always gives 
the same prediction, so it isn't doing anything useful.)

#### (Log) predictive density

Another option is to compute  **log predictive density** (lpd):

$$\mathrm{lpd}(\theta; y) = \log p(y \mid \theta)$$

Once again, $y$ is fixed, so this is a function of $\theta$.
In fact, it is just the log likelihood function. 
For a given value of $\theta$,
lpd measures (on a log scale) the probability of observing the data.
A larger value indicates a better fit.
Once again, because lpd is a function of $\theta$, 
it also has a posterior distribution. 

Assuming that the values of $y$ are independent given the parameters 
(and the predictor values $x$), this can be written as

$$
\mathrm{lpd}(\theta; y)
= \log p(y \mid \theta)
= \log \prod_{i = 1}^n p(y_i \mid \theta)
= \sum_{i = 1}^n \log p(y_i \mid \theta)
$$

In this case, we can compute the log posterior density pointwise and add.
In practice, this is often done even when independence does not hold. So 
technically we are working with **log pointwise posterior density**:


$$
\mathrm{lppd}(\theta; y)
= \sum_{i = 1}^n \log p(y_i \mid \theta)
$$
As with $SSE$, $MSE$, and $r^2$ this assigns a score to each $i$ and then sums over
those scores.

For linear models with normal noise and uniform priors, 
lpd is proportional to $MSE$ (and to $SSE$).
[^20-1]

[^20-1]: In this case, the posterior and the likelihood are the same, and
the noise distribution is normal.
The proportionality can be confirmed by observing that the "interesting part"
of $\log p(y_i \mid \theta)$ is $(y_i - \hat y_i)^2$.

#### Predictors

In the notation above, we have been hiding the role of predictors $x$ (and we will
continue to do so below).
A model with predictors makes different predictions depending on the 
vaules of the predictors. In all our examples, $x$ will be fixed, but we could
include it in the notation if we wanted.  For example,

$$
\mathrm{lpd}(\theta; y, x)
= \log p(y \mid \theta, x)
$$


#### Numbers from distributions

We can convert a measure $\mathrm{lpd}(\theta; y)$, which depends on $\theta$,
into a single number in several ways.  We will illustrate below

1. We could replace $\theta$ with a particular number $\hat \theta$.
($\hat \theta$ might be the mean, median, or mode of the posterior distribution
or the mode of the likelihood function, for example). 
If we do this we get the number

$$
\mathrm{lpd}(\hat \theta; y) 
= \log p(y \mid \hat\theta) 
= \sum_{i = 1}^n \log p(y_i \mid \theta)
$$
This is sometimes called a "plug-in" estimate since we are plugging in a single 
number for $\theta$.

2. Instead of summarizing $\theta$ with a single number, we could summarize
$p(y_i \mid \theta)$ with a single number by averaging over the posterior
sample values $p(y_i \mid \theta^s)$.  ($\theta^s$ denotes the value of 
$\theta$ in row $s$ of our $S$ posterior samples.)
If sum over $i$, we get the **log pointwise posterior density** (lppd):

$$
\mathrm{lppd}  
\approx 
\sum_{i = 1}^n \log \left( \frac{1}{S} \sum_{s = 1}^S  p(y_i \mid \theta^s)\right)
$$

This is an approximation because our poseterior samples are only an approximation
to the true posterior distribution. But if the effective sample size of the 
posterior is large, this approximation should be very good.


<!-- 1. Posterior predictive checks. -->

<!-- If our model is reflective of the way the data were generated, then we should be -->
<!-- able to use it to generate new data that is similar to the actual data. Posterior -->
<!-- predictive checks of various sorts can be use to investigate. -->

Unfortunately, both of these measures ($MSE$ and log predictive density)
have a problem. 
They measure how well the model fits the data used to fit the model, but
we are more interested in how well the model might fit new data 
(generated by the same random process that generated the current data).
This leads to **overfitting** and **prefers larger, more complex models**,
since the extra flexibility of these models makes it easier for them to 
"fit the data".

<!-- * We aren't really interested in how well our model fits the current data, but how  -->
<!-- well it would fit other data (new data to be collected in the future or hypothetical -->
<!-- data that could have been collected). -->

<!-- * It may be better to incorporate elements of multiple models into a final -->
<!-- model than to simply choose one of them. -->




### Out-of-sample prediction error

More interesting would be to measure how well the models would fit **new data**.
This is referred to as **out-of-sample prediction**, in contrast to 
**in-sample prediction**.  

So let's consider how well our model predicts new data $\tilde y$ rather than
the observed data $y$: 

<!-- \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{post}}(\mathrm{lpd}) -->
$$
\mathrm{lpd}(\theta; \tilde y) 
= \log p(\tilde y \mid \theta)
= \log \prod_{i = 1}^n p(\tilde y_i \mid \theta)
= \sum_{i = 1}^n \log p(\tilde y_i \mid \theta)
$$

which we can convert into a single number by plugging by posterior averaging:

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \mathrm{lpd}(\hat \theta; \tilde y) -->
<!-- = \log p(\tilde y \mid \hat \theta) -->
<!-- = \log \prod_{i = 1}^n p(\tilde y_i \mid \hat \theta) -->
<!-- = \sum_{i = 1}^n \log p(\tilde y_i \mid \hat \theta) -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- or by averaging over the posterior distribution -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \log p_{\mathrm{post}}(\tilde y) -->
<!-- = -->
<!-- \log \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{post}}(p(\tilde y \mid \theta)) -->
<!-- = -->
<!-- \sum_{i = 1}^n  -->
<!-- \log \left(\frac{1}{S} \sum_{s = 1}^S p(\tilde y_i \mid \theta_i)\right) -->
<!-- $$ -->

And since $\tilde y$ is not fixed (like $y$ was), we take an additional
step and compute the expected value (average) of this quantity over the 
distribution of $\tilde y_i$ to get the **expected log (pointwise) predictive density** for a new response $\tilde y_i$:^[20-2]

[^20-2]: Technically, we should be computing the average using an integral
instead of averaging over our posterior samples. But since this is a quantity
we can't compute anyway, I've expressed this in terms of an average over
our posterior samples.

$$
\mathrm{elppd} 
=
\mathrm{E}\left(\sum_{i = 1}^n \log p_{\mathrm{post}}(\tilde y_i)\right)
\approx
\sum_{i = 1}^n \mathrm{E}\left(\log 
\frac{1}{S} \sum_{s = 1}^S p(\tilde y_i \mid \theta^s))\right)
$$

This expected value is taken over the true distribution of $\tilde y_i$ (which is a
problem, stay tuned.)

### Approximating out-of-sample prediction error

What we would ideally want (elppd), we cannot compute
since it requires us to know the distribution of out-of-sample data 
($\tilde y_i$).
This leads us to the following impossible set of goals for our ideal 
measure of model (predictive) performance (borrowed from [@Gelman:2014]):

* an **unbaised** and **accurate** measure 
* of **out-of-sample prediction** error (elppd)
* that will be valid over a **general** class of models,
* and that **requires minimal computation** beyond that need to fit the model 
in the first place.

Here are three approaches to solving this problem

1. Use within-sample predictive accuracy.

    But this isn't ideal since it overestimates performace of the model
    (and more so for more complicated models).
    
2. Adjust within-sample predictive accuracy.

    Within-sample predictive accuracy will over-estimate out-of-sample predictive 
    accuracy. If we knew (or could estimate) by how much, we could adjust
    by that amount to eliminate (or reduce) the bias. Quantities like
    AIC (Aikeke's information criterion), 
    DIC (deviance information criterion), 
    and WAIC (widely applicable information criterion)
    take the approach of substracting something from lppd that 
    depends on the complexity of the model.

3. Use cross-validation

    The main idea here is to use some of the data to fit the model and the rest 
    of the data to evaluate prediction error. This is a poor person's version of 
    "out-of-sample".  We will focus on **leave one out** (LOO) cross validation 
    where we fit the model $n$ times, each time leaving out one row of the data
    and using the resulting model to predict the removed row.
    If we really needed to recompute the model $n$ times, 
    this would be too computationally expensive for large data sets and complex
    models.  But there are (more) efficient
    approximations to LOO-cv that make it doable. They are based on the idea
    that the posterior distribution using $y(-i)$ (all but row $i$ of the data)
    should usually be similar to the posterior distribution using $y$ (all of the data).
    So we can recycle the work done to compute our original posterior.
    The result is only an approximation, and it doesn't always work well, 
    so sometimes we have to recreate the posterior from scratch, at least for 
    some of the rows.

The formulas for **estimated out-of-sample predictive density**

\begin{align*}
\widehat{\mathrm{elppd}}_{\mathrm{AIC}}
  &= \mathrm{lpd}(\hat\theta_{\mathrm{mle}}, y) - p_{\mathrm{AIC}} \\
\widehat{\mathrm{elppd}}_{\mathrm{DIC}} 
  &= \mathrm{lpd}(\hat\theta_{\mathrm{Bayes}}, y) - p_{\mathrm{DIC}} \\
\widehat{\mathrm{elppd}}_{\mathrm{WAIC}} 
  &= \mathrm{lppd} - p_{\mathrm{WAIC}} \\
\widehat{\mathrm{elppd}}_{\mathrm{LOO}} 
  &= \sum_{i=1}^n \log p_{\mathrm{post}(-i)}(y_i) 
  \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \log \left( \frac{1}{S} \sum_{s = 1}^S p(y_i \mid \theta^{is})\right)
\end{align*}

and the associated **effictive number of parameters**:

\begin{align*}
p_{\mathrm{AIC}}  &= \mbox{number of parameters in the model}\\
p_{\mathrm{DIC}}  &= 2 \mathrm{var}_{\mathrm{post}}(\log p(y \mid \theta)) \\
p_{\mathrm{WAIC}} &= 2 \mathrm{var}_{\mathrm{post}}(\sum_{i = 1}^n \log p(y_i \mid \theta)) \\
p_{\mathrm{LOO}}  &= \hat{\mathrm{llpd}} - \hat{\mathrm{llpd}}_{\mathrm{LOO}} \\
\end{align*}

Notes

1. $\theta^{is}$ is the value of $\theta$ in row $s$ of the posterior distribution
*when row $i$ has been removed from the data*.  What makes LOO practical is 
that this can be approximated without refitting the model $n$ times.

1. AIC and DIC differ from WAIC and LOO in that they use a point estimate
for $\theta$ (the maximum likelihood estimate for AIC and the 
mode of the posterior distribution for DIC) rather than using the 
full posterior distribution.

1. AIC penalizes a model 1 for each parameter.  This is correct for linear
models with normal noise and uniform priors, but is not correct in general.
You can think of DIC and WAIC as estimating the effective number of 
parameters by looking at how much variation there is in $\log(p(y_i \mid \theta))$.
The more this quantity changes with changes in $\theta$, the more flexible
the model is (and the more it should be penalized).

1. LOO doesn't work by adusting for an estimated number of parameters;
it attempts to estimate elppd directly.
But we can reverse engineer things to get an estimated number of parameters
by taking the difference between
the (estimated) within-sample and out-of-sample predictive density.

1. LOO and WAIC are assymptotically equivalent (that is they give more 
and more similar values as the sample size increases), but LOO typically
performs a bit better on small data sets, so the authors of the loo package 
recommend LOO over WAIC as the go-to measure for comparing models.

1. Historically, information criteria have been expressed on the "devaiance scale".
To convert from log predictive density scale to deviance scale, we multiply by -2. 
On the  deviance scale, smaller is better. 
On the log predictive density scale, larger is better 
(but the values are usually negative.) The `waic()` and `loo()` functions 
compute both values.

1. The output from `loo()` and `waic()` labels things elpd rather than elppd.
    
<!-- The problem is that we have used all of our data to create our -->
<!-- model.  What to do? -->

<!--     a. Training and Testing -->

<!--     We could split our data into two portions. The first part (training data) -->
<!--     would be used to fit the model and the second (test data) would be used  -->
<!--     to measure how well the model performs. Models that are overfitting may do -->
<!--     well on the training data but do poorly with test data. Other models may -->
<!--     not do as well with the training data, but might do better with the test data. -->
<!--     We should prefer the latter sort of model. -->

<!--     The downside is that we have lost a portion of our data for fitting purposes. -->

<!--     b. Cross validation. -->

<!--     Cross validation is a bit like Train/Test repeated many times. Each time we fit -->
<!--     the model to a portion of the data and see how it performs on the rest  -->
<!--     of the data. LOO (leave one out) cross validation does this by leaving out -->
<!--     one row of the data and seeing how well a model fit to the remaining rows  -->
<!--     predicts it.  If we have $n$ rows of data, we can create $n$ leave-one-out  -->
<!--     models. -->

<!--     One downside of cross validation is that it can be computationally expensive. -->
<!--     (That's a lot of bayesian models to fit.) To speed things up, approximations -->
<!--     are used. The loo R package provides tools for computing approximate LOO -->
<!--     cross-validation on Bayesian models. The method employed goes by the name -->
<!--     Pareto smoothed importance-sampling leave-one-out cross-validation  -->
<!--     (PSIS-LOO). -->

<!--     c. Information criteria. -->

<!--     AIC (Aikeke's Information Criterion),  -->
<!--     DIC (Deviance Information Criterion),  -->
<!--     and WAIC (Widely Applicable Information Criterion) -->
<!--     are successively more complicated (and better) ways of estimating -->
<!--     out-of-sample prediction. As the names suggest, they are all based  -->
<!--     on a concept called information. The loo R package also provides -->
<!--     methods for computing WAIC (but it recommends using LOO). -->

  
<!-- ## Measuring fit -->

<!-- ### $R^2$ -->

<!-- Using $R^2$ alone as a measure of fit has the problem that $R^2$ increases -->
<!-- as we add complexity to the model, which pushes us toward overfitting. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Brains.R2 <- -->
<!--   data_frame( -->
<!--     degree = 0:6, -->
<!--     R2 = sapply( list(m7, m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6), mosaic::rsquared) -->
<!--   ) -->
<!-- Brains.R2 -->
<!-- gf_point(R2 ~ degree, data = Brains.R2) %>% -->
<!--   gf_line(R2 ~ degree, data = Brains.R2, alpha = 0.5) %>% -->
<!--   gf_labs(x = "degree of polynomial", y = expression(R^2)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- There are ways to adjust $R^2$ to reduce this problem, but we are going to introduce  -->
<!-- other methods of measuring fit. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- gf_point(R2 ~ degree, color = ~ factor(degree), data = Brains.R2) %>% -->
<!--   gf_line(R2 ~ degree, data = Brains.R2, alpha = 0.5) %>% -->
<!--   gf_segment(R2 + 1 ~ degree + 7,  color = ~ factor(degree),  -->
<!--              data = Brains.R2, alpha = 0.3) %>% -->
<!--   gf_labs(x = "degree of polynomial", y = expression(R^2)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Weather Prediction Accuracy -->

<!-- Consider the predictions of two weather people over the same set of 10 days. -->
<!-- Which one did a better job of predicting?  How should we measure this? -->

<!--  * **First Weather Person:** -->

<!--     ![](images/weather1.png) -->

<!--  * **Second Weather Person:** -->

<!--     ![](images/weather2.png) -->

<!-- Last time we discussed some ways to compare which weather person makes the best predictions. -->
<!-- Here is one more: Given each weather person's "model" as a means of generating data, which  -->
<!-- one makes the observed weather most likely?  Now weather person 1 wins handily: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # WP #1 -->
<!-- 1^3 * 0.4^7 -->
<!-- # WP #2 -- no chance! -->
<!-- 0^3 * 1^7 -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- This has two advantages for us: -->

<!--  1. This is just the likelihood, an important part of our Bayesian modeling system. -->

<!--  2. It is based on joint probability rather than average probability.  Weather person 2 is taking unfair advantage of average probability by making predictions we know are "impossible". -->

<!-- ## Shannon Entropy and related notions -->

<!-- Now let's take a bit of a detour on the road to another method of assessing the predictive -->
<!-- accuracy of a model.  The route will look something like this: -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \mbox{Information} \to \mbox{(Shannon) Entropy} \to \mbox{Divergence} \to \mbox{Deviance} \to \mbox{Inforation Criteria (DIC and WAIC)} -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- DIC (Deviance Information Criterion) and WAIC (Widely Applicable Information Criterion) are  -->
<!-- where we are heading.  For now, you can think of them as improvements to (adjusted) $R^2$ -->
<!-- that will work better for Bayesian models. -->

<!-- ### Information -->

<!-- Let's begin by considering the amount of  -->
<!-- information we gain when we observe some random process.   -->
<!-- Suppose that the event we observed has probability $p$. -->
<!-- Let $I(p)$ be the amount of information we gain from observing  -->
<!-- this outcome.  $I(p)$ depends on $p$ but not on the outcome itself, -->
<!-- and should satisfy the following properties. -->

<!--  1. $I(1)$ = 0.   -->

<!--     Since the outcome was certain, we didn't learn anything by observing. -->

<!--  2. $I(0)$ is undefined. -->

<!--     We won't observe an outcome with probability 0. -->

<!--  3. $I()$ is a decreasing function of $p$.   -->

<!--     The more unusual the event, the more information we obtain when it occurs. -->
<!--     In particular, $I(p) \ge 0$ for all $p \in (0, 1]$. -->

<!--  4. $I(p_1 p_2) = I(p_1) + I(p_2)$.   -->

<!--     This is motivated by independent events.  If we observe two independent  -->
<!--     events $A_1$ and $A_2$ with probabilities $p_1$ and $p_2$, we can consider this as a single event with -->
<!--     probability $p_1 p_2$. -->

<!-- The function $I()$ should remind you of a function you have seen before. -->
<!-- Logarithms satisfy these properties 1, 2, and 4, but logarithms are increaseing -->
<!-- functions.  We get the function we want if we define -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- I(p) = - \log(p) = \log(1/p) -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- We can choose any base we like: 2, $e$, and $10$ are common choices.   -->
<!-- Our text chooses natural logarithms.   -->
<!-- In can be shown that negative logarithms are the only -->
<!-- functions that have our desired properties. -->

<!-- ### Entropy -->

<!-- Now consider a random process $X$ with $n$ outcomes having probabilities  -->
<!-- $\mathbf{p} = p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$. That is, -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- P(X = x_i) = p_i, -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- The amount of information for each outcome depends on $p_i$. -->
<!-- The **Shannon entropy** (denoted $H$) is the average (usually called "expected")  -->
<!-- amount of information gained from each observation of the random process: -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- H(X) = H(\mathrm{p}) = \mathrm{expected \ information} =  \sum p_i \cdot I(p_i) = - \sum p_i \log(p_i) -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- Note that  -->

<!--  * $H(X) \ge 0$ since $p_i \ge 0$ and $I(p_i) = - \log(p_i) \ge 0$.   -->
<!--  * Outcomes with probability 0 must be removed from the list  -->
<!--  (alternatively, we can treat $0 \log(0)$ as $0$ for the purposes of entropy.  -->
<!--  Note: $\lim_{q \to \infty} q \log(q) = 0$, so this is a continuous extension.) -->
<!--  * $H(X)$, like $I(p_i)$ depends only on the probabilities, not on the outcomes themselves. -->
<!--  * $H$ is a **continuous** function. -->
<!--  * Among all distributions with a fixed number of outcomes, $H$ is **maximized**  -->
<!--      when all outcomes are equally likely (for a fixed number of outcomes) -->
<!--  * among equiprobable distributions $H$ **increases as the number of outcomes increases**. -->
<!--  * $H$ is **additive** in the following sense: if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then -->
<!--  $H(\langle X, Y\rangle) = H(X) + H(Y)$. -->


<!-- $H$ can be thought of as a measure of **uncertainty**. -->
<!-- Uncertainty decreases as we make observations. -->

<!--  * Consider a random variable that takes on only one value (all the time).   -->
<!--  There is nothing uncertain, and $H(X) = 1 \cdot \log(1) = 0$. -->

<!-- ```{r, chunk6.9a} -->
<!-- p <- 1 -->
<!-- - sum(p * log(p)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--  * A random coin toss has entropy 1 if we use base 2 logarithms.  (In this case the unit is called a **shannon**  -->
<!--  or a bit of uncertainty.) -->

<!-- Applied to a 50-50 coin we get: -->
<!-- ```{r, chunk6.9b} -->
<!-- p <- c(0.5, 0.5) -->
<!-- # one shannon of uncertainty -->
<!-- - sum(p * log2(p)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!--  * It is more common in statistics to use natural logarithms. -->
<!--  In that case, the unit for entropy is called a **nat**,  -->
<!--  and  the entropy of a fair coin toss is -->

<!-- ```{r, chunk6.9c} -->
<!-- p <- c(0.5, 0.5) -->
<!-- # uncertainty of a fair coin in nats -->
<!-- - sum(p * log(p)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We can write a little function to compute entropy for cases where there are only  -->
<!-- a finite number of outcomes. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- H <- function(p, base = exp(1)) { -->
<!--   - sum(p * log(p, base = base)) -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- # in nats -->
<!-- H(c(0.5, 0.5)) -->
<!-- H(c(0.3, 0.7)) -->
<!-- # in shannons -->
<!-- H(c(0.5, 0.5), base = 2) -->
<!-- H(c(0.3, 0.7), base = 2) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Decrease in Entropy = Gained Information -->

<!-- Decreases in this uncertainty are gained information.   -->



<!-- #### R code 6.9 -->

<!-- Applied to a 30-70 coin we get: -->
<!-- ```{r, chunk6.9} -->
<!-- p <- c(0.3, 0.7) -->
<!-- - sum(p * log(p)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Divergence -->

<!-- Kullback-Leibler divergence compares two distributions and asks "if we are  -->
<!-- anticipating \mathrm{q}, but get \mathrm{p}, how much more surprised will -->
<!-- we be than if we had been expecting \mathrm{p} in the first place?" -->

<!-- Here's the definition -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- D_{KL}(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{q}) =  -->
<!-- \mathrm{expected\ difference\ in\ ``surprise"}  -->
<!-- = \sum p_i \left( I(q_i) - I(p_i) \right) -->
<!-- = \sum p_i I(q_i) - \sum p_i I(p_i)  -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- This looks like the difference between two entropies.  It alsmost is. -->
<!-- The first one is actually a **cross entropy** where we use probabilities -->
<!-- from one distribution and information from the other.  We denote this -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- H(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q}) = \sum p_i I(q_i) = - \sum p_i \log(q_i) -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Note that $H(\mathbf{p}) = H(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{p})$, so -->
<!-- \begin{align*} -->
<!-- D_{KL} &= H(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{q}) - H(\mathrm{p}) -->
<!-- \\ -->
<!-- &= -->
<!-- \sum p_i \log(p_i) - \sum p_i \log(q_i) -->
<!-- \\ -->
<!-- &= \sum p_i (\log(p_i) - \log(q_i)). -->
<!-- \end{align*} -->


<!-- #### R code 6.10 -->

<!-- ```{r, chunk6.10} -->
<!-- # fit model with lm -->
<!-- m1 <- lm(brain_size ~ body_mass, data = Brains) -->

<!-- # compute deviance by cheating -->
<!-- (-2) * logLik(m1) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- #### R code 6.11 -->

<!-- ```{r, chunk6.11} -->
<!-- # standardize the body_mass before fitting -->
<!-- Brains <- -->
<!--   Brains %>% mutate(body_mass.s = zscore(body_mass)) -->

<!-- m8 <- map( -->
<!--   alist(brain_size ~ dnorm(mu, sigma), -->
<!--         mu <- a + b * body_mass.s), -->
<!--   data = Brains, -->
<!--   start = list( -->
<!--     a = mean(Brains$brain_size), -->

<!--   Brains$brain_size, -->
<!--   mean = theta[1] + theta[2] * Brains$body_mass.s, -->
<!--   sd = theta[3], -->
<!--   log = TRUE -->
<!-- )) -->
<!-- dev %>% setNames("dev")  # setNames just labels the out put -->
<!-- -2 * logLik(m8)        # for comparison -->
<!-- ``` -->


## Using loo

The loo package provides functions for computing WAIC and LOO estimates of 
epld (and their information criterion counterparts).
While the definitions are a bit involved, 
using WAIC or LOO to compare models is relatively easy.
WAIC can be faster, but LOO performs better (according to the authors of 
the loo package).

```{r ch20-waic-loo, cache = TRUE}
library(loo)
waic(fert4_brm)
loo(fert4_brm)
```

Sometimes the LOO-PSIS (Pareto-smoothed importance sampling) approximation 
method doesn't work well and `loo()` recommends refitting some of the models 
from scratch. This is based on the shape parameter (k) of the Pareto distribution
used to smooth the tails of the posterior.
Let's allow `loo()` to run from scratch the models it thinks need it. 
(This is still much faster than refitting a model for each row of the 
data since we only start from scratch a small number of times. And we don't
need to recompile the model, since that doesn't change; we just need to 
generate posterior samples using a different data set.)
If there are quite a number of these, `loo()` will suggest k-fold cross-validation
instead of leave-one-out cross-validation. These leaves out multiple rows of
data from each refit.  Since there are fewer models this way, it can exchange speed
for accuracy.


```{r ch20-loo-reloo, cache = TRUE}
fert4_loo <- loo(fert4_brm, reloo = TRUE) # refit as necessary
```

In this case, things didn't change that much when refitting the six "bad" models.

```{r ch20-loo4-reprise}
fert4_loo
plot(fert4_loo)
fert4a_loo <- loo(fert4_brm)
plot(fert4a_loo)
```

If we have multiple models, we can use `loo::compare()` to compare them based on
WAIC or LOO. Before doing that, let's add one more model to our list.

```{r ch20-fert5, results = "hide", cache = TRUE}
fert5_brm <-
  brm(Yield ~ Till + Fert + (1 | Field), data = SplitPlotAgri)
```

```{r ch20-waic-all, results = "hide", cache = TRUE}
library(loo)
compare(
  waic(fert1_brm), 
  waic(fert2_brm),
  waic(fert4_brm),
  waic(fert5_brm)
)
```

```{r ch20-loo2, cache = TRUE, results = "hide", cache = TRUE}
fert1_loo <- loo(fert1_brm) 
fert2_loo <- loo(fert2_brm) 
fert5_loo <- loo(fert5_brm) 
```


Now we can compare our four models using LOO:

```{r ch20-loo3, cache = TRUE, resuls = "hide"}
compare(fert1_loo, fert2_loo, fert4_loo, fert5_loo)
```


Important things to remember:

1. Estimated elpd and information criteria are not 
meaningful on their own, they are only useful for **comparisons**.

2. Comparisons can only be made among models that are fit using the **same data**
since the computed values depend on both the model and the data.

3. All of these methods are approximate. `loo()` and `waic()` provide 
standard errors as well as estimates. 
Use those to help determine whether differences between models
are meaningful or not.

4. `p_loo` (effective number of parameters) is also an interesting measure.
If this estimate does not seem to correspond to roughly the number of free 
parameters in your model, that is usually a sign that something is wrong.  (Perhaps
the model is mis-specified.) Keep in mind that multi-level models or models 
with strong priors place some restrictions on the parameters. This can lead
to an effective number of parameters that is smaller than the actual number 
of parameters.

5. This is only one aspect of how a model is performing. There may be good 
reasons to prefer a model with lower (estimated) log predictive density.
Posterior predictive checks, theory, interpretability, etc. can all be part
of deciding which models are better. But these methods can help us avoid 
selecting models that only look good because they are overfitting.

    Note: Sometimes the best solution is to create a new model that combines
    elements from models tried along the way.

6. Beware of "model hacking." If you try enough models, you might stumble across
something. But it might not be meaningful. Choose models with some thought, don't
just keep trying models in hopes that one of them will produce something interesting.

## Overfitting Example

### Brains Data

This small data set giving the brain volume (cc) and body mass (kg) for several
species.  It is used to illustrate a very bad idea -- improving the "fit" by 
increasing the degree of the polynomial used to model the relationship
between brain size and body mass.


```{r ch20-brains}
Brains <- 
  data.frame(
    species =  c("afarensis", "africanus", "habilis", "boisei",
                 "rudolfensis", "ergaster", "sapiens"),
    brain_size = c(438, 452, 612, 521, 752, 871, 1350),
    body_mass =  c(37.0, 35.5, 34.5, 41.5, 55.5, 61.0, 53.5)
  )
gf_point(brain_size ~ body_mass, data = Brains, 
         size = 2, color = "red", alpha = 0.6, verbose = TRUE)  %>%
  gf_text(brain_size ~ body_mass, label = ~species, alpha = 0.8, 
          color = "navy", size = 3, angle = 30)
```

To speed things up for this illustration, the model fits are frequentist
using `lm()`, but we could fit the same models using bayesian methods 
and `brm()`. The model being fit below is 

\begin{align*}
 \mbox{brain_size} & \sim \mathrm{Norm}(\mu, \sigma) \\
 \mu  & \sim a + b \cdot \mbox{body_mass} 
\end{align*}

There are no priors because `lm()` isn't using a Bayesian approach.  
We're using `lm()` here because it is faster to fit,
but the same principle would be illustrated if we used
a Bayesian linear model instead.


```{r, chunk6.2}
m1 <- lm(brain_size ~ body_mass, data = Brains)
```

(Note: `\lm()` fits the parameters using "maximum likelihood".  You can
think of this as using uniform priors on the coefficients, 
which means that the posterior is proportional to the likelihood, 
and maximum likelihood estimates are the same as the *maximum a posteriori* 
(mode of the posterior distribution) estimates.
The estimate for $\sigma$ that `\lm()` uses is modified to make it
an *unbiased estimator*.)

### Measuring fit with $r^2$

$r^2$ can be defined several equivalent ways.  
```{r ch20-chunk6.3}
1 - var(resid(m1)) / var(Brains$brain_size)
1 - 
  sum((Brains$brain_size - fitted(m1))^2) / 
  sum((Brains$brain_size - mean(Brains$brain_size))^2)
rsquared(m1)  # rsquared is in the mosaic package
```

In a Bayesian setting we would have a distribution of $r^2$ values, each computed
using a different row from the posterior sampling.

Now let's consider a model that uses a quadratic relationship.

```{r, chunk6.4}
m2 <- lm(brain_size ~ poly(body_mass,2), data = Brains)
1 - var(resid(m2)) / var(Brains$brain_size)
rsquared(m2)
```

We can use any degree polynomial in the same way.

```{r, chunk6.5, results = "hide", cache = TRUE}
m1 <- lm(brain_size ~ poly(body_mass, 1), data = Brains)
m2 <- lm(brain_size ~ poly(body_mass, 2), data = Brains)
m3 <- lm(brain_size ~ poly(body_mass, 3), data = Brains)
m4 <- lm(brain_size ~ poly(body_mass, 4), data = Brains)
m5 <- lm(brain_size ~ poly(body_mass, 5), data = Brains)
m6 <- lm(brain_size ~ poly(body_mass, 6), data = Brains)
```

`poly(body_mass, k)` creates a degree $k$ polynomial in $k$ (but parameterized in
a special way that makes some kinds of statistical analysis easier -- we 
aren't concerned with the particular parameterization here, just the overall
model fit).

And finally, here is a degree 0 polynomial (a constant).

```{r ch20-chunk6.6}
m7 <- lm(brain_size ~ 1, data = Brains)
```

### Leave One Out Analysis


Here's how you remove one row from a data set.
```{r, chunk6.7}
Brains.new <- Brains[-2, ]
```


One simple version of cross-validation is to fit the model several times,
but each time leaving out one observation (hence the name "leave one out").
We can compare these models to each other to see how stable/volitile
the moel fits are and to see how well the "odd one out" is predicted 
from the remaining observations.


```{r ch20-loo-funciton}
leave_one_out <-
  function(index = 1, degree = 1, ylim = c(0, NA)) {
    pf <- parent.frame(2)
    for(i in index) {
      BrainsLOO <-
        Brains %>% mutate(out = 1:nrow(Brains) %in% i) 
      for(d in degree) {
        p <-
          gf_point(
            brain_size ~ body_mass, data = BrainsLOO, color = ~out) %>% 
          gf_smooth(
            se = TRUE, fullrange = TRUE,
            brain_size ~ body_mass, formula = y ~ poly(x, d),
            data = BrainsLOO[-i, ], method = "lm") %>%
          gf_labs(title = paste("removed:", i, " ;  degree =", d)) %>%
          gf_lims(y = ylim) 
        print(p)
      }
    }
  }
```

The simple linear model changes only slightly when we remove each data point 
(although the model's uncertainty decreases quite a bit when we remove the 
data point that is least like the others).

```{r ch20-loo-example-1, warning = FALSE}
leave_one_out(1:nrow(Brains), degree = 1, ylim = c(-2200, 4000))
```
Cubic models and their uncertainties change more -- they are more sensitive to the data.

```{r ch20-loo-example-3}
leave_one_out(1:nrow(Brains), degree = 3, ylim = c(-2200, 4000))
```

With a 5th degree polynomial (6 coefficients), the fit to the six data points 
is "perfect", but highly volitile. 
The model has no uncertainty, but it is overfitting and overconfident.  
The fit to the omitted point might not be very reliable.

```{r ch20-loo-example-5}
leave_one_out(1:nrow(Brains), degree = 5, ylim = c(-2200, 4000))
```

## Exercises {#ch20-exercses}

1. The `CalvinBayes::Seaweed` data set (adapted from [@Qian:2007]) 
records how quickly seaweed regenerates when in the presence of different types
of grazers. Data were collected from eight different tidal areas of the Oregon
coast. We want to predict the amount of seaweed from the two predictors: grazer
type and tidal zone. The tidal zones are simply labeled A–H. The grazer type was
more involved, with six levels: No grazers (None), small fish only (f), small
and large fish (fF), limpets only (L), limpets and small fish (Lf), limpets and
small fish and large fish (LfF). We would like to know the effects of the
different types of grazers, and we would also like to know about the different
zones.

    a. Create a plot that puts `SeaweedAmt` on the y-axis, `Grazer` on the
    x-axis, and uses `Zone` for faceting. Use `gf_jitter()` to avoid overplotting.
    Set `height` and `width` to appropriate values so the plot is still easily
    interpretable.
    
    ```{r ch20-prob1-plot, include = FALSE}
    gf_jitter(SeaweedAmt ~ Grazer | Zone, width = 0.3, height = 0,
              data = Seaweed, shape = 21)
    ```
    
    b. Fit a model with both predictors and their interaction assuming
    homogeneous variances in each group. Why would it not be a good idea
    to fit a model with heterogenous variances?
    
    c. What is the effect of small fish across all the zones? Answer
    this question by setting up the following three contrasts: 
    none versus small fish only; 
    limpets only versus limpets and small fish; 
    the average of none and limpets only versus 
      the average of small fish only and limpets with small fish.
    Discuss the results.
   
    d. What is the effect of limpets? 
    There are several contrasts that can address this question, 
    but be sure to include a contrast that compares all of the locations
    with limpets to all of the locations without limpets.
   
    e. Set up a contrast to compare Zone A with Zone D. Briefly discuss the 
    result.
    
    f. Does the effect of limpets depend on whether the location is in zone A or D? 
    Use an appropriate contrast to find out.


<!-- Exercise 19.3. [Purpose: Use the heterogeneous-variance model to examine differences of scales across groups.]  -->
<!-- Note: added WAIC and LOO part and moved to this chapter. -->

2. This problem investigates the synthetic data set `CalvinBayes::NonhomogVar`.

    ```{r ch20-prob2-plot, echo = FALSE}
    gf_jitter(Y ~ Group, data = NonhomogVar, 
              width = 0.3, height = 0, shape = 21)
    ```

    a. From the plot, it is pretty clear that that variance is not the same
    across the groups.  Fit two models.
    
    ```{r ch20-prob2-models, eval = FALSE}
    model1_brm <- brm(Y ~ Group, data = NonhomogVar)
    model2_brm <- brm(bf(Y ~ Group, sigma ~ Group), data = NonhomogVar)
    ```
    
    b. What is the difference between these two models?  (That is, what does 
    `sigma ~ Group` do?)
    
    c. Describe the priors for each model.  (Use `prior_summary()` if you are 
    not sure.)
    
    d. Create the following plots:
    
        i. A plot showing the posterior distributions of 
        $\sigma$ from model 1 and each of the $\sigma_j$'s from model 2.
        (Stack multiple calls to `gf_dens()` on a single plot.  Use
        `color` or `linetype` or `size` or some combination of these to make 
        them distinguishable.
        Note: `color = ~"sigmaA"`, etc will give you a nice legend.
        This works for `linetype` and `size` as well.)
       
        ii. A plot showing the posterior distribution of $\sigma_A - \sigma_B$
        in model 2.
        
        iii. A plot showing the posterior distribution of $\sigma_B - \sigma_C$
        in model 2.
        
        iv. A plot showing the posterior distribution of 
        $\frac{\sigma_A + \sigma_D}{2} - \frac{\sigma_B + \sigma_C}{2}$ in model 2.  
        
    e. Use each model to answer the following:
    
        i. Are the means of groups A and B different?
        ii. Are the means of groups B and C different?
        
        Explain why the models agree or disagree.
        
    f. The original plot suggests that model 2 should be preferred over model 1.
    Compare the models using WAIC and LOOIC.  Are these measures able to 
    detect that model 2 is better than model 1?
    
    ```{r ch20-prob2-waic, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    compare(waic(model1_brm), waic(model2_brm))
    compare(loo(model1_brm), loo(model2_brm))
    ```
    
3. Create a model like `fert4_brm` but use `family = student()`. This will
add a parameter to your model. According to WAIC and LOO, which model should 
your prefer?  (Note: the answer can be neither.)
